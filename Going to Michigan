as the car rolled north towards michigan you complained
that all i like to listen to is gary neuman and the tubeway army
well maybe that's true
but what about you
and the blue cheer comprehensive retrospective box set
that's pretty annoying too.
the window flew open.
the air was thin.
i heard you say so and i heard
shadings of meaning again
and your fingers touched mine
and that supersonic whine began
near the back of my head
and the white rose burned.
you know exactly what i mean about the burning white rose
yes you do
yes you do
