i'm not going to say what i came over to say to you.
but you were thinking along the same lines
and you let the words come ringing through.

i wouldn't've said that to you.
i wouldn't say it if they paid me to.

you got no manners
you got no manners at all
you got no manners
you got no manners
you got no manners at all
you got no manners

i'm going to try real hard,
but i, i can't believe that you're really going to do it
it's like one of those chinese kites flying in the wind
and then some kid with a shotgun sends a bullet through it.

and i, i  came here to say it,
but i've done that before.
but i've never, um, told you that i don't love you anymore.

you got no manners.
you got no manners at all.
you got no manners.
you got no manners.
you got no manners at all.
you got no manners.
you got no manners.
you got no manners at all.
you got no manners.
