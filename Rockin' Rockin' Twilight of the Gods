switched on the radio this morning.
heard about the local savings and loan.
how they went under,
took with them everything i own.
that's alright.
it doesn't make me nervous.
'cause i can see the clouds gathering in the distance.
and everytime it rains, it rains pennies from heaven.
and everytime it rains, i'm a rich man.
and everytime it rains, i'm indescribably wealthy.
and everytime it rains, gold coins spill from the heavens straight into my hands.

many have said that the devil was coming.
i looked down at the sidewalk -- three inches of water running.

i looked up at the clouds.
everything looked great.
the financial news network talked about the prime lending rate.
that's alright.
i'm safe and warm.
just over there ya know, near south ontario,
i can see the signals of a tropical storm.
and everytime it rains, it rains pennies from heaven.
and everytime it rains, i'm a rich man.
and everytime it rains, i'm indescribably wealthy.
and everytime it rains, tech stocks spill from the heavens straight into my hands.

many have said that the devil was coming.
i looked down at the sidewalk from the window -- three inches of water running.
