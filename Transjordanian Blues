this church is rotten from the top down.
this church is rotten from the top down.
but i, i am going to clean house tonight.
and it's going to go back into the earth it rose from.

these walls can't keep the world at bay.
no, these walls can't keep the world at bay.
our time, our time is limited and precious.
but this place, this place is limitless and pernicious.

would you all just follow me out into the open?
leave your coats and handbags, damn it all.
can't you see the floors are smoking?

this church is not long for this world.
this church is not long for this world.
and if you're wondering who to blame,
i want to praise his name with songs and feasting.
follow me to the open field
where the truth will be revealed if you're really listening.

hosannah, hosannah, i am saved by the blood of the lamb.
one day when i was lost, he died on that cross,
and i am saved by the blood of the lamb.
