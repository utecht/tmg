the rain came and washed the new potatoes away.
we saw them floating across the backyard.
there they go.
we'll never see them again, ya know.
so good bye to the new potatoes.
good bye, and god-speed.

there they go.
we will never see them again you know.
so good bye to the new potatoes.
good bye.
good bye.
