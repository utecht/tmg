when I ask you to look at me 
you look away. 
I ask you to tell me something nice once. 
you come at me with all your hot lights on display. 
I know you're changing. 
damn you. 
I know you're changing. 
god damn you for that. 

when the snow stacked up outside,
you looked around. 
I could see you from the window. 
I could see the snow coming down. 
I know you're changing. 
damn you. 
I know you're changing. 
god damn you.
