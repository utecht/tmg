those may be the most beautiful shades of red i've ever seen.
but don't be fooled.
if the sun goes down us here tonight,
it's not gonna be alright anymore.

none of this has anything really to do with us, that's my belief.
as the desert sky throws the glowing neon into bold relief.
your mouth is open and your eyes are wide.
hold on because it's dark outside now.

the smell of roses comes thickly through the open window now.
the smell of roses comes thickly through the open window now.
as the darkness closes in, our bodies draw the roses in.
and those may be the most beautiful shades of red i've ever seen.
