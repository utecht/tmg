The neighbors are cloning themselves
We found their cocoons in the garbage
We'll either stay high forever, crash in an hour or two
Sleeping the sleep of the blessed
Picking through trashcans with you

The guy on TV is a prophet
You just have to look in his eyes
We'll either turn our lives over to Christ or
We'll just drift off trying to better ourselves
Giving up after one or two tries

The high school's a front for the yakuza
Everyone, everyone knows it
We will all shortly be richer than God if we'll just hold on
As long as we play all our cards right
As long as nobody here blows it
I've drawn up a map of the autumn
The holding tank's full for the night
I heard all about it on Citizen's Band
It's a brand new day
We'll be awake until Thursday
The future's disarmingly bright
