'36 Hudson in the garage,
all sorts of junk in the unattached spare room.
Dishes in the kitchen sink,
new straw for the old broom, 
friends who don't have a clue,
well meaning teachers ...

but down in your arms, in your arms,
I am a wild creature.

Floor two-foot-high with newspapers,
white carpet thick with cat hair,
half-eaten gallons of ice cream in the freezer,
fresh fuel for the sodium flares ...

I write down good reasons to freeze to death
in my spiral-ring notebook.

But in the long tresses of your hair,
I am a babbling brook.
