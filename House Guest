Mailman came while you were out
I was sleeping at your house
Letter from your lover
With an Ottawaï»¿ address

Fill the shower up with steam
Find out what you mean to him
Before I hand it over
I'll push the flap back down and I'll press

Yes, I'll leave everything the way I found it
I'll bet I'm the best house guest, house guest you ever had
I'll bet I'm the best house guest, house guest you ever had

Never leave my socks around
Always keep the TV down
And when I leave
I never leave a mess

We were resting on the couch
There was nothing much to watch
Other than my manners
And your waning graciousness

Eased your thumb off the remote (he looks really uncomfortable!)
Placed my palms against your throat
The heat in here's infernal
Well, so's that entry in your journal, yeah!

It changed everything the day I found it
I'll bet I'm the best house guest, house guest you ever had
I will bet I am the best house guest to ever crash at your pad, man

I've done things in your room you'd be ashamed to accuse me of
It's just a tendency I have when certain people refuse me love
Refuse me love, refuse me love

You refuse, I accuse!

Yes, I'll leave everything the way I found it.
