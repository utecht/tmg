The ghostly sing-song
And the children playing double-dutch
I felt the wind come through the window
I felt it turn around and switch back
In a second story room
In Jamacia, Queens
Your hair was dripping wet
Your skin was clean
And the children skipping rope
Tripled their speed
You were all I ever wanted
You were all I'd ever need
In New York City
In the middle of July
The air was heavy and wet
The air was heavy, your body was heavy on mine
I will know who you are yet
I will know who you are yet
