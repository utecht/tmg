Here come the times of changing tide.
Here come the days of light and grace.
Here come the hours of wordless wondrousness.
Light, light will fill this humble place.

When you come, the stars will shine brighter than spun gold.
When you come, the world will seem shiny and new.
My mom told me that someday someone like you would come to set things right.
'Till you come, I'll keep this place ready for you.

I saw them riding up the road.
And I swept and scrubbed the stable twice.
Filled it with golden yellow straw, sweet and clean.
I did my best to make things nice.

When you come, the stars will shine brighter than spun gold.
When you come, the world will seem shiny and new.
My mom told me that someday someone like you would come to set things right.
Until you come, I'll keep this place ready for you.
