I know your world is full of people who have nothing,
who have nothing to give,
who have nothing to give.

I know everyone's trying to sell you the illusion 
that keeps them in hell, 
that keeps them down in hell. 

I'm stuck in my confusion, but I know that you'll go far, 
you're chased by the horizon, because you know who you are. 

Hope you remember who you are.
Remember who you are. 

I know they only see you as someone they can use,
as someone they can pick or choose,
and then blame you when they lose.

I don't want to be a mistake that only falls of of your radar,
you can't afford a mistake
because you know who you are. 

Hope you remember who you are. 
Remember who you are. 

All I can give you is one of my stupid songs,
and I know it's not the real thing.
Wish I could give you the real thing.

I'm lost in the sky but I would bet upon your star,
you're alone in this life unless you know who you are. 

I hope you remember who you are,
you gotta remember who you are. 
Remember who you are, yeah.
