Weather cell from northern Canada
Due in before the afternoon is over
Brown cows in the fields
Eating their way slowly through the clover

And the canopy of apple trees before us
Symmetrical and pure as a pagoda
Me and Lee Charm from Chicago in a U-Haul
Headed out through western Minnesota

Headed for the islands
Headed for the islands

Our load is heavy, you can hear it shifting
Say what you like, I'm never going to stop
Everyone will eat when we've arrived
White apple blossoms soften up the blacktop

Two days from now we'll get to where we're going
The western sky will pitch-correct its winding
Our cargo's going to spill out from the cabin
And rub its eyes and see the silver lining, yeah, yeah

Headed for the islands
Headed for the islands
