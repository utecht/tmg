meanwhile downstairs
i'm setting up shop
a little too proud
to let the matter drop

i can you see you up there,
isn't it romantic?
you're huffing and puffing
their chairs on the titanic
and i reach for a glass
of cool water drawn from the rivers of babylon.

meanwhile outside,
the stars have come out.
and the humid summer air
tugs at the ring in my snout.
and you come to the window,
and i spread wide my arms.
jump if you want to jump.
jump if you want to.
the water's warm.
me, i know.
i know 'cause i've been swimming.
blindly along through the rivers of babylon.
