hurry the bottle mama. 
it's grapefruit wine. 
kick off your high-heeled sneakers 
it's party time. 
the girls don't seem to care what's on. 
as long as it plays 'till dawn. 
no static at all. 

give her some fucked-up music 
she treats you nice. 
feed her some hungry reggae 
she'll love you twice. 
the girls don't seem to care tonight 
as long as the mood is right. 
no static at all. 
no static at all. 
hey.
