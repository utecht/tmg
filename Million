when i came back from finland
the taxi took me down the street 
i saw the red flowers growing like they used to by the roadside
in the smothering summer heat

you were standing out in front of the house
with your floral print dress on
and you had questions only a masochist would ask 
writen all over your big brown eyes
the moon is high over iowa at night 
the moon is high over iowa at night 
and i brought your a blanket
hand woven, hand dyed
the moon is high over iowa at night
