we spilled out through the front door
into the blinding lade light
sun reflected on the storefront windows
tremendously bright
we were norwegians come down from the north
attacking the walls of the fortress
i was permanently at the point of exhaustion
you were gorgeous

who's here?
just us
nobody else around
stray electrical currents 
trying to find the ground

we haunted the halls of the pharmacy
artlessly shoplifting random things
painkillers, cough syrup, tiger balm
bubblegum, cigarettes, and shower curtain rings
we were portuguese warships cresting the waves
cannons raised ready to dock
you were counting down the hours and minutes
i was trying to find a way of stopping the clock

who's here?
just us
nobody else around
stray electrical currents 
trying to find the ground
