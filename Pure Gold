Hey don't touch the door
Because the door will surely kill you
I hear you saying that you don't see what I mean
Well you better look again
Stop looking at the floor
Because the whole building's 
Turning and turning and turning
And don't touch the door
Can't you see the door's burning
And all at once 
The street is filled with light
And all at once 
The street is filled with sound
When I hold you I know 
Our number's being called somewhere
Let them come on down
