the car wouldn't start
and i had to walk
I headed out arrow toward western rock
I looked through the fence
heavy machinery shining in the moonlight
and a huge yellow tractor caught my eye
I heard the wheels crunch the gravel I was feeling alright

the tractor spoke 
in drawn out syllables
the tractor sang
in long whole notes

I'm getting out of here
coming to you like a bullet
I'm getting out of here
coming to you like a bullet

he gave me that liquid laugh when i got home
as i tried to describe the bright yellow body and the shining chrome come alive
i knew you'd laugh but that particular tone of yours just cuts me in half
you don't know what it's like to hear a big dumb machine spell out the details of your life

and the tractor spoke to me
in drawn out syllables
the tractor sang
in long whole notes

I'm getting out of here
coming to you like a bullet
I'm getting out of here
coming to you like a bullet
