You say I've forgotten what being young's all about
How could you say that to me?
You say I don't know how to have fun anymore
Well that just maybe
But it maybe otherwise
Try me
See if it isn't so
I got a hand gun and a bottle of brandy let's go

You try and trace Taurus in the sky for me
But I know you don't know what you're doing
When I turn my face towards the cold clean sidewalk
I can see the world glowing
You say I've forgotten what love's all about
You say I don't know how to shake the cobwebs out
I look into your eyes
And I see the fury grow
I got a hand gun and a bottle of brandy let's go
