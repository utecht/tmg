[spoken:] the actual date is the 17th of april. love hymn to aphrodite. 

the sunset gets a little longer every night 
and it's no good but I feel alright. 
the sky turns orange and the colors start swirling. 
you float downstairs, your body spinning 
in perfect circles. 
it's the 18th of july, but what are you doing?
