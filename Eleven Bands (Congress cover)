Follow the grass up the mountain 
Up the foot of the mountain
Follow the twisting branches
When you look at them
Remember that they are alive, growing still
See their colors lighten as you climb
Watch the sunlight catch them and reflect them
It reflects them everywhere

One of these paths leading up the nameless mountain
Was the one that told you something once
But you will not find it here
It has shriveled up and pickeled off the mountain
Like a dying vine
Once these things take on their weightlessness
The structure comes apart

How do the trees grow in this weather?
It is freezing cold
Take the map on up the mountainside
And all the sounds from far and wide will leave you suddenly
And sugar winds come through the clouds
