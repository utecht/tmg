the cactus cut ? root,
the tea you brought me smacked of passion fruit.
in a room where the heat bled in though the wall,
i let breathing in the design of it all
what is there to regret?
your mouth was wet.
and your shoulders rolled under mine.

i saw the glaze come over your eyes.
i felt my blood pumping and the heat rise.
i've seen pretty eyes before, but never like those
and your body open like a new rose
what more is there to say?
the air gave way.
i was melting and sweltering under you.
