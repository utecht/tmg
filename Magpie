feed the kittens in the kitchen
set food out for the strays
try hard to do your best
the magpie will have his way

fill your mouth with berries
by the full light of the moon
work all night if you have to
the magpie comes at noon

shore up the crucifixes 
above the archways and the doors
the magpie will come at midday
and you will go down on all fours

and when the cherries ripe with blossoms
be ready and be brave
and remember what we had here
when there was something left to save
