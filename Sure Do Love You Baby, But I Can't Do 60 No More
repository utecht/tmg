they moved down here and you came down too
where the surf's always wild and the skies are blue.
got my blood pressure measured down in pajo key.
one sixty-five over one twenty-three.
and the lights are low over pompano beach tonight.
and one light is flickering out for the last time.

coconuts growing in the coconut tree,
surf and turf and sand and sea.
down here in the wreckage, just us three,
him and you.
you and me.
and the lights are low over pompano beach tonight.
and one light is flickering out,
out for the last time.
