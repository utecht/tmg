...he'll still be like 
...it's so good. she's 
...tell ya about personal testimony 
...please keep feeding us 

the young sun 
the old story forming 
hasn't been the same 
since dad came by this morning 
did you see the way mom's looking at us 
mark it well 

your eyes meet mine 
when we hear her call 
the strange birds in the yard 
a portrait of the symbols that she painted on the garden wall 
did you see the way mom's looking at us 
did you see the way mom's looking at us 
don't say anything
