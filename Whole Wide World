The last of the repercussions
Died off real slow
The sky was still
The cold sun sank down beneath the snow
I hung by my hand
From the tree outside
I looked on
The Whole Wide World

The voices came quietly
I shut them down
Tricky young southerly wind
Came at me with it's high whistling sound
I turned around to face it
With real arrogance burning inside
And I drank in 
The Whole Wide World
