i took the horse tooth necklace
down from the nail where it was hanging
and I wound it three times round my wrist
and I felt that stinging ringing feeling come down
i remember you
i remember what we used to do
hello sarah
hello sarah
hello sarah

i looked around our newly excavated cave
and i saw that centuries
had left our little room unchanged
and i felt your spirit moving
it made such perfect sense
i heard the jangling of your ornaments
hello sarah
hello sarah
hello sarah
