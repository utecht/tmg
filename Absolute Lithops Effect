after one long season of waiting,
after one long season of wanting,
i am breaking open.
my insides are pink and raw.
and it hurts me when i move my jaw,
but i am taking tiny steps forward.
and i... i feel sure that my wounds will heal.
and i, i will bloom here in my room.
with a little water.
and a little bit of sunlight.
and a little bit of tender mercy,
tender
mercy.

the big trucks come up the highway.
and the big wheels rattle my windows.
and night, night comes to texas.
after one blind season alone in here,
after one long sweltering summer,
i, i'm going to find the exit.
and i will go to the house of a friend i know.
and i will let myself forget.
with a little water.
and a little bit of sunlight.
and a little bit of tender mercy,
tender
mercy.
