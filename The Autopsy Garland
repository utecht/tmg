One clear shot or else he gets away
Red sun high in the sky tonight
Look west from London down to old Hollywood
Remember the first days in california


You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on
You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on

Fat rich men love their 12-year-olds
Deco cufflinks and cognac by the glass
Look West from London toward the emerald city
Remember Minnesota

You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on
You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on

Or their gloves...

Sweet spearmint  and bitter tangerine
Bedside decked with roses
Look West look West look West and look away
From old familiar faces

You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on
You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on
