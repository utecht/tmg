They hook you up to a fentanyl drip to mitigate the pain a little bit
I flew in from Pennsylvania when I heard the hour was coming fast
And I docked in Santa Barbara, tried to brace myself
But you can't brace yourself when the time comes
You just have to roll with the blast

And I'm an eighteen-wheeler headed down the interstate
And my brakes are gonna give and I won't know 'til it's too late
Tires screaming when I lose control
Try not to hurt too many people when I roll

Find the harbor freeway and head south
Real tired, head kind of light
I found Telegraph Road - I'd only seen the name on envelopes
From the parking lot and turned right
I felt all the details carving out space in my head
Tropicanas on the walkway, me on red

Between the pain and the pills trying to hold it at bay
Stands a traveler going somewhere far away
And I am an airplane tumbling wing over wing
Try to listen to my instruments, they don't say anything
People screaming when the engines quit
I hope we're all in crash position when we hit

And then came to your bedside
And as it turns out, I'm not ready
And as though you were speaking through a thick haze
You said hello to me
We all stood there around you, happy to hear you speak
The last of something bright burning, still burning
Beyond the cancer and the chemotherapy
You were a presence full of light upon this earth
And I am a witness to your life and to its worth
It's three days later when I get the call
And there's nobody around to break my fall
