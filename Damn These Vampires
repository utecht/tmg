Brave young cowboys
Of the near north side
Mount those bridge rails
Ride all night
Scream when captured
Arch your back
Let this whole town hear
Your knuckles crack

Sapphire Trans-Am
High beams in rain
Drive wild broncos 
Down the plain
Push up to the corner
Where the turbines hiss
Someday we won't
Remember this

Crawl 'til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these vampires
For what they've done to me
Tie those horses 
To the post outside
And let those glass doors
Open wide
And in their surface
See two young, savage things
Barely worth
Remembering

Feast like pagans 
Never get enough
Sleep like dead men
Wake up like dead men
And when the sun comes
Try not to hate the light
Someday we'll try
To walk upright

Crawl 'til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these bite marks
Deep in my arteries
Crawl 'til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these vampires
For what they've done to me
