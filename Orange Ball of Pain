when i saw it on the bakery carousel 
i knew i had to have it for my own
i eased it out
and i brought it home

why don't you try some
i already had some myself
is that the most delicious thing 
you ever tasted in your life
is that the most delicious thing 
you ever tasted in your life

and then the cold sorrow gripped me by the throat
and then i felt the colder sadness taking hold
i knew i had to have it for my own

why don't you try some
why don't you try some
is that the most delicious thing 
you ever tasted in your life
is that the most delicious thing 
you ever tasted in your life

and then i saw the snow against the window
and then i saw the snow hit the window
and then i saw the snow brush against the window
and then i saw the snow in here
