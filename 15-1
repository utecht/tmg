if I had a car and you were riding in it 
I'd show you what my car could do 
I head east down highway fifteen and see the starlight 
shower over you 
gas fumes rising from the blacktop 
cheap hotels with flashing signs 
just an old sweet song made new 
and oozing through the pines 

if I had thirty dollars and I could make time stop 
and the moon was high up above 
and moon beams fell like sweet cream 
and the night air would carry our dark dreams 

gas fumes off the highway  
neon flashing everwhere 
just an old sweet song made new by your body 
and desert flowers blooming in the thick night air
