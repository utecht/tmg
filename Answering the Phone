Maybe I didn't get enough milk when I was a baby
Maybe I never learned the value of a penny
Maybe I listened to that first Black Sabbath album, the one with the witch on the front, one time too many
But I think something wrong with me
I think something's wrong with me
I think something's glued down wrong permanently.

Maybe it's the things I never learned how to do
Maybe it's the things I learned to do real well
Maybe it's the Irish whiskey that I like to drink 
Maybe it's the California zinfandel
But I think something's wrong with me
I think something's glued down wrong, maybe permanently. 

I'm gonna tell you once, you gotta listen
You came here for comfort, you came to the wrong place
I got a strong stomach and a murmur in my heart, 
I got a tremor in my hand, muscle twitches in my face
And I think something's wrong with me
I think something's snapped on wrong, maybe permanently 
Yeah!
