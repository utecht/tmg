i went down to loyd center
looking for you
but a mouth full of anger
blocked my view
he took your hand
there in the skating rink
god will give him 
blood to drink
saw the two of you leaving
didn't want to follow behind
but i could see the rest of your evening
burning in my mind
sky is black
the moon is pink
god will give him
blood to drink

looked over the railing
ice was white
on the north east side
i saw you and your boyfriend
on a friday night
i went mining for gold
i struck pure fresh zinc
god 
god will give him
blood to drink

hey hey hey
