I saw you. I saw your hair. 
I could spend the rest of my life in there. 

I saw you, and I sank into your eyes. 
I'm not going to apologize. 

because you, with your own hands, 
made the whole world. 
you can't fool me. 
I'm on to you now. 

because you, with your own hands, 
created everything. 
you can't fool me.
I'm on to you now. 

yeah, I saw you, but you saw me first, 
living water to quench my thirst. 
and you tell me quiet down, 
but I have no doubt. 
I know what you're all about, 

because you, with your own hands 
made the whole world. 
you can't fool me. 
I'm on to you now. 

because you, with your own hands, 
created everything. 
you can't fool me any more. 
I'm on to you now.
