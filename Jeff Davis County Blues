after three nights in jail 
I head north from Toyahvale
switched to two eighty five in Pacos
head up to the Red Bluff
my walk's real steady 
and my eyes are real cold but i 
always feel like I'm sixteen years old
lost in a travel lodge
with the television on with the sound down
I don't feel so tough
old issues of sunset magazine 
to read
sleep for twelve hours
dream about home

I have no place to go
so i drive up to new mexico
fix my eyes in the rear view
when I cross the state line
and i panic i guess
and although it's quite late
take the first exit to one twenty eight
I am
coming back to midland
I hope you won't mind
polaroids of the two of us
scattered on the passenger seat
I drive slowly
and evenly
and I dream about home
