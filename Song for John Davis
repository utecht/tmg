the day we set sail from england
the wind behind us was fair
the day we set sail from england
there were smiling faces everywhere
and the snow came down on new hampshire today
and the snow came down on new hampshire today

the day we put the grain into the ground
there were smiling faces all around
and underneath the trees we planted when we landed

when i was a child
i spoke with the language of a child
but when i became a man, i put away childish things
and the snow came down on new hampshire today
and the snow came down on new hampshire today
