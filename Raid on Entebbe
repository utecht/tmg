on the shores of a lake named after a late queen of england
i heard new rumors of war.
the sun was a red ball up in the summer sky.
i saw my sister standing in the doorway.
she had that look on her face that reminded me of you.
the reports were coming hourly and the sky was blue.
they were shifting the power again.
they always do this when i come home.

i tucked my shirt in, though i don't know why.
shielded my eyes from the light up in the sky
'cause it was shining, blazing, like a highway flare
in the incredibly impossibly dry air
i heard my mother call my sister to the kitchen again
and thought that everything was headed straight down the drain
they positioned themselves in strategic locations
i was beginning to lose my patience.
if you'll just put your hand in mine,
we're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
