the wind blew in across the water
and the wind blew through you hair
and i walked around the lake's perimeter
and then i saw you there

i will grab you by the ears 
i will grab you by the ears 
i will grab you by the ears 
and you will know something
you will know something

i saw the birds fly out across the lake
i saw the birds go by
and i walked around the lake's perimeter
and i saw the lake reflected in your eyes

i will grab you by the ears 
i will grab you by the ears 
i will grab you by the ears 
and you will know something
you will know something
