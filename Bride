Designed for one another, 
we lie tied to our slabs.
While the same electricity that gave us life,
crackles through the lab,

And I am too dumb 
to tell you how I feel.
Who will know who will tell anyone,
that what we had was real?

We belong dead, we belong dead.

So I try and try to focus,
to say what I want to say.
But it's such hard work,
and we don't have all day.

Our efforts won't add up 
to any great amount
Get one chance to make your gesture down here,
I wanna make mine count.

We belong dead, we belong dead.
We belong dead. We belong dead.
