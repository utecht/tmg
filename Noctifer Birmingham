i had to stop and catch my breath
when the telephone rang out as loud as death
it was three in the morning
there was a low drone of katydids behind your voice
when i came down from harrisburg pennsylvania
and i saw you by the highway

you asked me if the north was alright
and i said it got kind of cold at night
i could feel your bones shivering way down there in birmingham
and when i came down from harrisburg pennsylvania
and i saw you by the highway

you reminded me of all the things you'd given up forever
and you asked about the children
and you asked about the weather
and then i came down from harrisburg pennsylvania
and i saw you by the highway
