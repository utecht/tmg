there's a north wind coming in 
and there's a west wind coming in 
and there's an east wind coming in 
and there's a strong wind blowing in from the south 
and there's a sweet metallic taste in my mouth. 
there's a dead feeling lingering over the wind. 

and there's a one-way ticket in my hot little hand 
and I'm kissing your eyelids and I'm going to japan. 

there's life and liberty on my tongue 
and there's a dead silence where the wind-chimes hung 
and on some mountain somewhere in the world it's snowing 
but here in the fields there's not a thing growing. 
maybe next year, ya know, there is a way of knowing. 
there's wind coming in from all directions. 
there's a coat on my shoulders--midnight connections. 

and I'm kissing you and leaving you behind in the sand. 
I'm holding you a while then I'm going to japan.
