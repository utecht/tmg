when the rainbows disappeared from the skies of northern florida
because the rain had gone away,
and i looked out on the front lawn and i saw you there.
it was 6:31 AM on a saturday.
and you turned into a housecat, 
and you all think i'm making this part up,
but you're wrong, wrong, you're wrong.

and the wind came through the window.
and it my licked at my face.
and i heard the sound of about a thousand housecats
squalling up from all over the place
and you all think i'm crazy
or making up some kind of cute story
or telling little jokes to amuse myself with
but you are wrong.
i am going to dade county right now.
