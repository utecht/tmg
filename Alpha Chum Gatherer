Rise up real early shaking 
try and steady my hand 
Make my way down to the water 
Sail a half a mile from land 

See where the sharks have been feeding 
out on the ocean alone 
and I scrutinize the carnage 
like it was the goddamn Rosetta Stone 

When I crack 
that secret code 
Itâ€™s sure to lighten my load 

Wonâ€™t you come out sailing with me 
Into the warmth of the afternoon 

Scoop up the guts and brains 
Drizzle them into a plastic bag 
Watch them drop onto the deck 
Feel the day drag 

And when I get back to the car 
itâ€™s like a furnace inside 
I head on down the highway 
throttle open wide 

Back home in the high heat 
I spill out all my presents for you 
Thereâ€™s blood all over the floor now 
What are we going to do 

Wonâ€™t you come out sailing with me 
Into the warmth 
warmth of the afternoon
