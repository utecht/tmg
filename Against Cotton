when i worked down to the liquor store
guy with a shotgun came raging through the place
muscled his way behind the counter
i shot him in the face

this morning i went down to the catholic church
cause something just came over me
forty-five minutes in the pews
rain the rosary 		

when the last days come
we shall see visions
more vivid than sunsets
brighter than stars
we will recognize each other 
and see ourselves for the first time
the way we really are

decorative gritting on my window
gets a little rustier every year
i donï¿½t know how the metal gets rusty
when it never rains here

a year or so ago i worked at a liquor store
and a guy came in 
tried to kill me
so i shot him in the face
i would do it again
i would do it again

when the last days come
we shall see visions
more vivid than sunsets
brighter than stars
we will recognize each other
and see ourselves for the first time
the way, the way we really are
