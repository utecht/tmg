what's going to be the death of me?
static electricity.
what's making me take it all too far?
you are.
you are.

what's kepping me up at night?
the streetlight.
what's finally gonna let me sleep alright?
you might.
you might.

how do i know what i know?
where did our love go?
how come the river froze over this year?
what are we hiding here?
i saw you waiting by the mailbox.
saw the mailman come.
saw the neighbors poke their heads out of their windows.
i saw everyone.
