the light hit the rings
glimmering on his fingers
the light came down
and his hands hit the keys
it utterly wasted me in sweden
the horns punched the air
the aftermath fell around everywhere
i saw the spotlight land on his rings
and i'd had just about enough losing things
in sweden in nineteen sixty-two
quite some distance from you
