dull powder blue paint job.
earl scheib special.
dashboard full of talismans to try and push fate.
rabbit skull hanging from the rearview.
six kicking cylinders, lined up straight,
and i ride.
and i glide down the streets of this city all night, uptight.
jenny's on the cellular, high as a kite.

there's a crack in the windshield eighteen inches long.
evaporating snow forming crystals on the chrome.
brand new battery i shoplifted from the pet boys.
full cranking power to bring me on home,
and i ride.
and i glide down the streets of this city all night, uptight.
jenny's on the cellular, high as a kite.
sometimes the moon shines like a beacon to the weary and the sick in spirit.
sometimes... sometimes it's dark.
