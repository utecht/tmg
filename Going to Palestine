that woman set herself on fire
they said it on the radio
they said she lit off the skies of palestine
i could not stand to hear them say so
i saw the stars come out
i saw the oranges on the trees
later on they played some carribean song
man they sure know how to pick 'em
the rich voice burning like a fuse
the syncopated rhythms
i saw the stars come out
i saw the oranges cracking open
i saw you standing there
orange blossom in your hair
going to palestine
going to palestine
