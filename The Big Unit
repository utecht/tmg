I sunk all of my money into Swiss gold
and I watched the markets slide
and I stood on the edge of the pacific
and watched the hypodermic needles coming in with the tide
there are two guys just outside of Chicago looking for me tonight,
but Randy Johnson throws a baseball 97 miles an hour and I'm gonna be alright.

I had a fully loaded junk bond portfolio that
didn't work out like it was supposed to
there's a mountain of money in the bond market
that I can't seem to get close to
I've been headed down the road to ruin.
the end is nowhere in sight.
but Randy Johnson throws a baseball 97 miles an hour and I'm gonna be alright.
