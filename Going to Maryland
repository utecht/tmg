the water's real cool and the water's real sweet
here's hoping that no points repeat
because i bet against the chances that you'd ever be mine
laid everything down on the don't pass line

chorus
and it's a stupid trick of fortune anyway
but the lights are bright tonight
and your eyes shine tonight on chesapeke bay

walk through the water and our feet get wet
and on the dark ended water i see your silhouette
5 dollars says that it's gone in a minute
5 dollars says that your heart goes with it
