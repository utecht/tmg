water came springing out the side of the wall, 
and I guess the same thing will happen to us all. 
we don't know how to explain what I mean, 
I mean to say it's kind of hard to explain. now, 

let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 

water came down through the cracks in the ceiling, 
but this time the water had a different feeling. 
it's the sort of feeling that is hard to explain, 
so, let me put it to you in a different way. now, 

let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 

you're the salesman. I'm the buyer. 
you're the tractor. I am the tire. 
I'm the glass. you're the water that fills me. 
I hear them coming. now, 

let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me. now, 

let them kill me. yeah! 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me.
