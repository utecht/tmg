a neighboring clan went on the attack
and stole all the giant coco-yams from the barn out back
i will make them pay for taking my yams away

i carved out little figurines of thieves
burned a palmful of red dust from the medicine bag
broke a kola nut in half, i hate half of it myself
sat back and watched the evening drag
i will make them regret that they haven't brought my yams back yet
