Kelly said the van was streaked with broken sides of you,
Tapes and magazines, all your goodness beaming through
Sorting through your suitcase by the highway in the sun
Somewhere in Louisiana when you really need to run; your legs
Will bend and buckle, there is nowhere to go 

So you walk sideways

Two sad young men one February, digging through a wreck
Cleaning out the tour van, check and double check
Nothing left inside now, nothing left to do
Empty out the empties, half this stuff belongs to you
When you load on something heavy, you've gotta watch your back

So you walk sideways
