I dug a hole and filled it up with compost
Rested on the cool grass for a minute
I saw the future in a dream last night
There’s nothing in it


I set the sapling in the hole
Started gently tapping down the dirt
I saw the future in a dream last night

Somebody’s gonna get hurt, somebody’s gonna get hurt
I hope it’s not me
But I suspect it’s going to have to be


I dug my heels in for the winter
And I waited for the snow
But something was stuck up in the clouds
Something was stuck up there
It couldn’t let go

And when its time came I could see it happen
Blossoms black and sweet as Texas crude
I saw the future flowering like a ruptured vessel
Somebody’s gonna get screwed
It won’t be me
Someday I am going to walk out of here free
