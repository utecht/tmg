smell of sulfur, cloven hoof,
birds were gathering on the roof.
faint voices, scratching sounds.
if this keeps up, i may never come down.
by the time i snapped out of it, there was nothing left.
by the time i snapped out of it, there was nothing left.
by the time i snapped out of it, you were long gone.
by the time i snapped out of it, you were long gone.

spinning numbers, shepherd songs,
birds singing all the time -- all wrong.
aunt margaret, cotton-eyed joe,
they swear they're my friends, but i don't think so.

by the time i snapped out of it, there was nothing left.
by the time i snapped out of it, there was nothing left.
by the time i snapped out of it, you were long gone.
by the time i snapped out of it, you were long gone.
