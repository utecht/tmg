*hello there paul. i had a take and i listend to it and i was ready to send it then i thought, you know...it could be done better. so here it is then. now i have my boots on, which always garuntees a good showing.*

you must try to lead a good life
you must do unto others 
as you would have them do
so that when you die
you'll find golden boy peanuts
waiting in the afterlife for you

there are no pan-asain supermakets 
down in hell
so you can't buy golden boy peanuts
there are no pan-asain supermakets 
down in hell
so you can't buy golden boy peanuts
yeah

if thine enemy oppresses you
you must 
let him opress you some more 
so that when you go shoping in paradise
you'll find those magnificent peanuts
from singapore
with the drawing of the 
young chinese farmer
eastern sun behind him
smiling at you from the shelves
if we want to spend eternaty in happynes
we are going to have to watch ourselves

you must give to the march of dimes
you must be on gaurd against wickednes
at all times
and you will 
find that your efforts
have brought you great joy
when your
spirit is munching on that 
golden boy 

there are no pan-asain supermakets 
down in hell
so you can't buy golden boy peanuts 
there
but the 
streets of heaven are lined with shells
and there's billboards of the golden boy 
everywhere

there are no pan-asain supermakets 
down in hell
so you can't buy golden boy peanuts
there are no pan-asain supermakets 
down in hell
so you can't buy golden boy peanuts
go!
