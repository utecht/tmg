the waves were beating
against the shore
the waves were beating
as if they hadn't before
the dock was soaking
the wood was wet
your hair blew madly
i can't forget.
we went down to the boat.
we went down to the boat.
yeah!

the rushing water
the pale sky
hey, that's a good way
to let the dock dry
you know what i mean
we were slaves
the word was lurching 
the dark way
as we went down to the boat
we went down to the boat.
we went down to the boat.
we went down to the boat.
yeah!
