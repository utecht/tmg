when the power of god shows up in your swing,
and the people start to notice and you can't do anything about it
and they all come out to see you. 
they start to crowd around.
let me tell ya brother, you can feel it coming down.
and i got an angel watching over me,
a monkey on my back,
the devil at my heels,
reporters breathing down my neck.

yeah my daddy always to me to finish what ya start.
my wife's about to leave me and it's going to break my heart.
and i no longer have my youth.
i no longer have my looks.
i got a god damned one-way ticket to the god damned history books.
and i got an angel watching over me,
a monkey on my back,
the devil at my heels,
reporters breathing down my neck.
hey, hey.
