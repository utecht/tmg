there was a twinkle in my eye
as we watched the fish swim by
we saw the water going in and out
and you knew what i was thinking about

we watched the water
we looked right through it
and i let my hand rest a minute on your stomach
like there was nothing to it

three of them hiding behind a rock
and i got too nervous to talk
with your wondrous form all stretched out
right next to me as the fish swam about

we watched the water
we looked right through it
and i let my hand rest a minute on your stomach
like there was nothing to it

the room heated up the windows were closed
we heard the humming of the air hose
that ran into the tank and the fish swam in place
and i fixed my eyes on your beautiful face

we watched the water
we looked right through it
and i let my hand rest a minute on your stomach
like there was nothing to it
