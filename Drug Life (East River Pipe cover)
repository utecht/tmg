Hey, where's my pills?
They were sitting on the window sill.
Should have known something was wrong 
When last week you tossed my favorite ball 
Now it's gone
You're messing with my drug life
You're messing with my drug life
We flash up the Union Square
People walk in serotonin pairs
I remember it was only play 
Devil's sucking in the protÃ©gÃ©s
Just shuffle off through the golden mist
Take a number because you're on the list
And later off Second Avenue
If it comes down to the drugs or you
Baby, we're through
Because you're messing with my drug life
You're messing with my drug life
You're messing with my drug life
You're messing with my drug life
