bang, pow! look at me now. 
don't let the cows stray off too far. 
come down, take a good look around. 
see how the cows start to shine like light bulbs. 

I love the cows. 
I love the cows. 
I love the cows, yeah. 
I love the cows. 

rain comes, strikes you dumb. 
re-seed the meadow so the cows don't starve. 
mud puddle's a fine place to cuddle. 
you're a mosquito or a mosquito's baby. 

I love the cows. 
I love the cows. 
I love the cows. 
I love the cows. 

they're smiling in your face. 
all the time they wanna take your place. 
yeah you know who I mean, 
talkin' about those cow-machines. 

I love the cows. 
I love the cows. 
I love the cows. 
I love the cows.
