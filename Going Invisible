When I rose from a heavy sleep
I was stepping lightly
And I put on my gray suit
And the matching fedora

Ready to face the world
Fairly nearly ready
Came down the hallway
Looked in the mirror

I’m gonna break Something
I’m gonna break Something
Today
And sweep all the pieces away

And I stood before the mirror then
Like I was waiting for a phone call
Squinting like a lost traveler in a thick fog
But nothing clear came into view 
Except for you
Just off in the distant horizon
Something hidden in your hand

I’m gonna break something
I’m gonna break something
Today
And sweep all the pieces away

So I pulled my hat brim down over my eyes
And preened and posed and tried my new self on for size
Then I was out the door in the faint winter sunlight
Just a number in the crowd smiling at everyone

Ah but who’d smile back at a face like that?
I’m gonna break something
I’m gonna break something
Today
And sweep all the pieces away
