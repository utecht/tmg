radical colors on the eastern sky,
the blinding symmetry,
the little white lie,
your small hand waving in the cold air,
the ridges of the mountain frozen on the skyline there.
when the sun came out over norway today,
i saw you going away.
there was nothing good in your going.
there was nothing good in your going.

i cut the flowers that grew near the door
and i arranged them in the center of the floor.
the room was so empty.
there were pale shadows inside.
when the sun came out over norway today,
i saw you going away.
there was nothing good in your going.
there was nothing good in your going.
