there was rain
there was wind
there was spring coming in
there was a feeling of approaching doom
and i was happy to see you
it was cold in your room, 

you were warm
and that's all i remember
and your arms were warm
and that's all i remember

later on near morning
we were talking about nothing
a little rain
a little wind
quiet cold cold air coming in
and you were warm
and that's all i remember
and your arms were warm
and that's all i remember
and your eyes were pretty
and that's all i remember
and your hands were soft
and that's all i remember
and the hall was well lit as i walked down it
and that's all i remember
and the rain was light and it felt soft on my face
and that's all i remember
and the car was quiet inside
and that's all i remember
and it was dark when the sunlight was coming
and that's all i remember
