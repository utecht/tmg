there's no wolves around here.
there's no wolves around here.
have a drink.
drink your fill.
from the tap. 
from the still.
if you won't, i will.
but there are no wolves around here.

there's no reason to cry.
there's no reason to cry.
you can have a seat for a while.
relax.
smile.
but don't touch that dial,
'cause there is no reason to cry.

there's a gutteral stop in my throat.
there's a gutteral stop in my throat.
the wind comes in from far and wide.
sands blow.
grains collide.
i'm changing inside.
and there's a gutteral stop in my throat.
