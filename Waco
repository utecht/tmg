where the dry dust turns the sunset pink.
where all summer long it's so hot that you can't think straight.
where we pump water from a well by hand.
half a world away from the old promised land.
we understand that we've been given
a new covenant -- a real sharp one.
and we spend our days and nights
gaining new appreciation of its finer points.
and waiting for the dead to rise up from their graves.
waiting for jesus to come along and save us. and 
biding our time.
biding our time.
biding our time as best we know how.

where the texas doughboys used to play
before the wind blew everything away.
where we came to get away from our friends.
where we'd tell each other jokes waiting for the world to end.
we know our jokes are funny,
but in all the wrong ways and for all the wrong reasons.
and we rent old George Romero movies
and relish the short time left.
waiting for the dead to rise up from their graves.
waiting for jesus to come along and save us. yes, and
biding our time.
biding our time.
biding our time as best we know how.
