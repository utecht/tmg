where the dry dust turns the sunset pale.
where all summer long we saw ?? and faced her.
where we pulled water from a well by hand.
half a world away from the old promised land.
where you stand we've been given
a new covenant -- a real sharp one.
and we spend all our days and nights
gaining new appreciation of its finer points.
and waiting for the dead to rise up from their graves.
waiting for jesus to come along and save us. and we are
biding our time.
biding our time.
biding our time as best we know how.

where the texas doughboys used to play
before the wind blew everything away.
where we came to get away from our friends.
where we'd tell each other jokes waiting for the world to end.
we know our jokes are funny,
but in all the wrong ways and for all the wrong reasons.
and we watch old George Romera movies
and relish the short time left.
yeah, waiting for the dead to rise up from their graves.
waiting for jesus to come along and save us. yes, and
biding our time.
biding our time.
biding our time as best we know how.
