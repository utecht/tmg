Peppers on the plants
Plum tomatoes ripening on the vine
Midsummer evenings on the back porch
Barbecued sweet corn, sweet white wine
When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you
When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you

Bottle after bottle of the cheap stuff 
Feeling two degrees north of all right
Heaven help us, heaven help us
We're all gonna die tonight
When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you
When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you

Party goes on 'til the end of August
The tensions build, the air currents throb
Mosquitos suck the blood right out of my body
Why don't they finish the job
When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you
When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you
