Catch a lucky break, try to make it last
Rig a blanket curtain up between 
the present and the past

Play my lucky numbers 
for most of what they're worth
Lie about my age right down to my last day on this earth

Set your sights on good fortune
Concentrate
Pull back the hammer 
Try to hold the gun straight

Hit the gym each night, 
stay cool and seldom speak
Keep the heart of a champion
Never let them see you're weak

And whatever they say 
on your page three mention
Focus on the parts that make you feel good
Be grateful for the attention

Set your sights on good fortune
Concentrate
Pull back the hammer 
Try to hold the gun straight

Try to hold the gun straight
And true
And steady
Let the frame find you when the cameraman's ready

Work until I drop
Drift from place to place
Ehrenfeld, Pennsylvania
scratched into my face

Set your sights on good fortune
Concentrate
Pull back the hammer 
Try to hold the gun straight
Try to hold the gun straight
