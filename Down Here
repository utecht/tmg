on venus it rains sulfuric acid
and the raindrops evaporate before they hit the ground

japanese red-crowned cranes by the water here
trouble in town
i feel like i'm gonna drown down here
it's all coming down down here

hurricane's in from australia
tore up the neighborhood
a telegram from lithuania
and the news is not good
and i don't speak the language down here
it's all coming down down here
yeah

johnson johnson is my name
brooklyn is my station
heaven is my resting place
and God is my salvation
