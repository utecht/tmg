you come around here when the lights are down low.
and you hang around for six or seven hours and then you get ready to go.
well, i remember when you used to kiss me without me asking you to.
yeah i remember when you used to.

when i lean toward to you, you turn away.
it's a quarter past one a.m. on a warm saturday.
that's alright, that's alright, i hear you.
don't do anything you don't want to do.
but, i remember when you used to kiss me without me asking you to.
yeah i remember when you used to.
