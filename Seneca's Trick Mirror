seventeen years ago, they told me to teach you everything i know.
i let the fire rain down, rain down.
watched it flare up inside his heart.
saw it tearing him completely apart,
head to toe, i know.

and blood will run through the streets of Rome today,
and roll across the ocean.

fourteen years ago tonight
watched him tearing through the garden killing everything in sight.
i let my curiosity get the best of me.
i saw the source-less anger eating at him from inside.
no one around him to stem the rising tide.
evil from his head down to his feet 
quinine's bitter.
sugar's sweet.

and blood will run through the streets of Rome today,
and roll across the ocean.
