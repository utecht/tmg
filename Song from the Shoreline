through the bodies of a hundred people, i saw you.
i saw you coming through the crush.
saw you pushing through.

and in the bodies of a hundred people moving around,
i shut my ears off to the world, 
i couldn't hear a sound.
in the bodies of a hundred people, i saw you.
i saw you coming through the crush.
i saw you pushing through.
