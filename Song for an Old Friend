the garter snake passed lazily through the tall yellow-headed sourgrass
there was cold, clear water in a tall, clean glass
the sunlight hit the sides and it came through the water tilted
I saw the condensation on your hand 
I could feel the glaciers melting

and a warm, soft wind
covered up everything
on the day your love came screaming through me

you had oranges and lemons in a canvas bag beside you
and seven different kinds of light welling up inside of you
you smeared citrus pulp all over me, it felt okay
good old east rutherford three thousand miles away

I felt the warm surge blast my mind
coming in from behind
on the day your love came screaming through me

in the fresh light of day
I felt something falling away
on the day your love came screaming through me
