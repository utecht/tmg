The clouds explode and then the desert blooms
Someone will need to mop this floor for me
When I emerge I find my car
Like a cathedral in a dream of the future

Drive 'til the rain stops
Keep driving

Pull over and blast off when I get the chance
Clear as an insect's wings in sunlight
Flip on the high stakes radio
Try to sing the words right

Drive 'til the rain stops
Keep driving

I had his arms tied up behind him
We were together all day
Maybe make CuliacÃ¡n by sunset
Try to anyway

High as the clouds now
Flying
Drive 'til the rain stops
Keep driving
