When we hid out behind the risers at the high school
Working bitter calculations with a slide rule
The grim particulars of poisoning the swimming pool
The way you looked me in the eye, ready to die

We were becoming what we are
Collapsing stars

When we chewed up children's tylenol like bubblegum
Till our hearts were beating deep and rich as kettle drums
We knew if we waited long enough the change would come
And then the day did come, and at last

Hold tight
Hold fast
Catch lightning in a jar
Collapsing stars

Told you to load up on provisions
We wouldn't be back for a while
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
Turn toward the camera and smile, smile, smile

When we ditched the plan to poison all our enemies
Tucked our weapons in a clearing, and covered them with leaves
We are gonna come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaths one day
Well we are on our way

You can look 
But you won't find 
Another love like i
Collapsing stars
