hang my hammer on a nail
never see it again
set sail for the cosmos
high above the world with its beaten down men
not long for this world
have to be reminded
to stay away from windows
not to leave important things behind

all gone
all gone
with the dawn

and then I'm on an airplane heading west
over the ocean
unsteady on my feet again
a body in motion
so far from the slaughterhouse
new creatures with new hearts
landing at la guardia
tearing up the charts
