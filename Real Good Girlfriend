I woke up this morning, 
my new girlfriend beside me.
I don't have to lie about her.
I don't need some dumb story to hide me.
she turned 20 last April, she's as tall as I am,
she came to this country all the way from Siam.
I may not be the greatest guy in this town,
people may have good cause to put me down,
but I've got a real good girlfriend now.

we stood on Chicago Avenue, 
hey look--here comes the bus.
slipped on a solid sheet of ice, (?)
watched the number 66 fly right past us.
I may not be the greatest guy in this town,
people may have good cause to put me down,
but I've got a real good girlfriend now.
