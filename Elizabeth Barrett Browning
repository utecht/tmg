i saw the building burning down.
i saw the dogs come running in two by two.
i saw the feast of saint christopher beginning.
i drew connecting lines between these things.

you say i need to get some sleep.
you say i need to take it easy for a while.
you say i'll never learn to swim at this rate,
but i'm waiting for you downstairs
and the water's rushing in on me.

so i guess the wheel's been set in motion.
i guess the ship, it's gone and left it's little harbor.
i guess we'll wait and see what happens to us next.
and i can't wait because there's rats in the walls.
there are rats in the walls.
there are rats in the walls.
there are rats in the walls.
there are rats in the walls.
there are rats beneath the floorboards,
rats up in the ceiling.
rats in the walls,
there are rats in the walls.
