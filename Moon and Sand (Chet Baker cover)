deep is the midnight sea
warm is the fragrant night
sweet are you lips to me
soft as the moon and sand

oh when shall we meet agin
when the night has left us 
will the spell remain

the waves invade the shore
though we may kiss no more
night is at our command
moon and sand

the waves invade the shore
though we may kiss no more
night is at our command
moon and sand
