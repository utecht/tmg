The best ever death metal band out of Denton
were a couple of guys
who'd been friends since grade school
one was named Cyrus
the other was Jeff
and they practiced twice a week in Jeff's bedroom

The best ever death metal band out of Denton
never settled on a name
but the top three contenders
after weeks of debate
were â€œSatanâ€™s Fingersâ€ and â€œThe Killersâ€ and â€œThe Hospital Bombersâ€

Jeff and Cyrus believed in their hearts
they were headed for stage lights and Lear jets and fortune and fame
so in script that made prominent use of a pentagram
they stenciled their drumheads and guitars with their names

This was how Cyrus got sent to the school
where they told him he'd never be famous
and this was why Jeff
in the letters he'd write to his friend
helped develop a plan to get even

When you punish a person for dreaming his dream
don't expect him to thank or forgive you
the best ever death metal band out of Denton
will in time both outpace and outlive you

Hail Satan
Hail Satan, tonight
Hail Satan
Hail, hail
