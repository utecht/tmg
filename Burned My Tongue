woke up this morning about a quarter to five
said the prayer you'd taught me to keep myself alive,
it burned my tongue.
it burned my tongue.

fried some grains in butter, 
said a simple grace,
sat down at the table,
fed my greedy face.
it burned my tongue.
it burned my tongue.

looked out at the ocean
i could see it so clear.
said the only name
i can ever stand to hear.
it burned my tongue
it burned my tongue.

when i ask you to sing with me
i wish you'd sing along.
thirty years in this world -- 
thirty years too long.
it burns my tongue.
it burns my tongue.

you tooks away my friends.
you took my will to live.
i gave you all i got.
what more have i got to give?
it burns my tongue.
it burns my tongue.
it burns my tongue.
it burns my tongue.
