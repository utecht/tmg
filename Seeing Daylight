two cans clear chicken broth
two white onions
one bulb garlic

boil, boil.
boil, boil.

and the screams of delight from the pool outside
the splashing sounds
the coffee heating up on the stove
the sky outside. the color of pure fresh milk.
boil, boil.
boil, boil.

and the phone ringing, and me picking it up
and watching myself do so
in the quiet room

in the june evening and your voice on the other end
and the impossibility of your voice on the other end
and the impossible echo. inside.

boil, boil.
boil, boil.
