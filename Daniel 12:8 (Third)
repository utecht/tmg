walk in the darkness - bump into things all night
get dizzy and angry searching for some source of light
unknown alphabets in spray paint on the street
seek out their source and find it and fall down at its feet

get some asprin powders to rub into my gums
wait for the pain to hit me - buckle when it comes
feel it drill in like a corkscrew
avert my eyes when the cause comes into view

feel the fear in my chest all day
praise you anyway
feel the fear in my chest all day
praise you anyway

see the road rise to the summit up ahead
remember an old friend with a pistol to his head
when it comes my time for the laying on of hands
let me feel the blow when it lands

look for the secrets half buried like trinkets in a field
hope that the hidden things someday will be revealed
stumble through the darkness can't see anything at all
whimper like a whipped dog when i fall

feel the fear in my chest all day
praise you anyway
feel the fear in my chest all day
praise you anyway
