Playing in the bricks and the foundry dust
I lost track of time

I'm gonna get it when I get home
He's gonna kill me when I get home

That love should turn to bitterness
All so naturally
Poison from my pretty song
Turn to ruin me

I'm gonna get it when I get home
He's gonna kill me when I get home

I know you must have held me once
I saw a photograph
Safe and happy in your arms
A smiling god of wrath

I'm gonna get it when I get home
He's gonna kill me when I get home

One sunny judgment day
I lost track of time
Playing in the bricks and the foundry dust
I lost track of time
