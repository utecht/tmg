when I woke up on saturday and you came in 
you brought the sunlight in 
I felt sleep slipping away from me 
I feel things occasionally like this 
fresh cherries 
hanging from your fingers 

when the water on the window let the sunlight through 
and I got a good look at you 
standing above me bright and tall 
there are no words for it 
there are no words at all 
I saw 
fresh cherries 
hanging from your fingers
