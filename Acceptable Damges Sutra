I had some high hopes had some high hopes
For the coming year
But as it turns out nothing ever really changes here
And when I’ve had about as much as I can take
When I feel myself just about to break 
I lean into the wind
And like an infant I reach out for your hand
Fool me once you know

Shame, shame
Shame, shame

And as we rehearse our scene we really put our hearts into it
And I feel an opening to wiggle through but I don’t want to do it
But some habits are hard to break hard to break
And some aren’t really habits anymore
And when the full force of the hurricane nearly knocks me on the floor
I lean into the wind
And like an infant I reach out for your hand
Fool me once you know

Shame, shame
Shame, shame
