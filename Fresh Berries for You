the world's overrun with new shades of green,
and the dandelions come up like recurring dreams
and the swallows give up their fragile little songs
in the new world

and i know you're only watching out for yourself,
and i know i'm not to take it real personal-like
and i know you only want what's best for everybody.
i know you only want what's best for everybody.

but you better be nice, or the easter bunny's
gonna strike you name out of the
little red book with the silver hinges on it
that he carries.

they've implemented a new system on the
exhaust lines of the buses
and now the air is fresh and sweet and clean when they pass by.
and the bright sun shines down on our fair city,
and young cats play on people's front lawns.

and the time is coming.
and the time is coming.
and i can feel the time coming.
and i know that you can feel the time coming, yourself.

and the easter bunny's coming,
and god knows i'd hate for you to miss it.
and it's gonna be so nice.
when the easter bunny comes.
and it's gonna be so nice.
when the easter bunny comes.
and it's gonna be so nice.
when the easter bunny comes.
and it's gonna be so nice.
when the easter bunny comes.
