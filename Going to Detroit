As the car rolled north
toward Michigan
you complained
that all I ever listen to is Gary Numan and the Tubeway Army.
Well, maybe that's true.
What about you?
And the blue cheer comprehensive retrospective box set:
That's pretty annoying, too.
The wing window flew open
and the air was thin.
I heard you say so.
And I heard the shadings of meaning therein.
And your fingers touched mine,
and that supersonic whine
began near the back of my brain
and the white rose burned.
You know exactly what I mean about the burning white rose.
Yes you do.
Yes you do.
