i hear the pads beat, loud as drums.
i know he's coming. let him come.

chorus
let the big big rabbit come out.
let the big big rabbit come down.
let him cast his shadow on the bright face of our little house.
let him dance through the garden. 
let him come.

it's getting darker, as the sky grows colder
and i feel your hand on my naked shoulder.
praise god i know you're with me. i know you're here.
i can feel you breathing. i know you're near me. 
ok
