In December in California the air was hot
And I carried the Christmas tree down Indian Hill to the Gemco parking lot
What did I see?
What spectacle confronted me?
Ten thousand Christmas trees

And the people standing around and the smiles on their faces
And the boards in the shapes of Xs hammered into the Christmas tree's bases
I took in the smell I looked around
And among ten thousand Christmas trees
I lay down
