I know you see mars in the sky tonight 
I know you can see venus rising and veering off to the right. 
but can you see that young star overhead? 
it's the one that designed my undoing. 
I know that in california the waves break on the beach. 
and I know that the foam on the breaking waves 
is as white as household bleach. 
but do you see that particular white right now 
it's the color of the young star coming on down. 
I got joy joy joy in my soul tonight 
I got joy joy joy in my arms alright. 
although you treat me badly,
I love you madly. 
you really got a hold on me. 
you really got a hold on me.
