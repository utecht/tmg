there's power in the name.
but the name's been lost for centuries.
there's poison is in the water
but the water tastes like honey
and we're so thirsty we don't care where we wake up tomorrow.
we don't care, the question can hardly hold our attention.
and this is a song for your young men to sing when they run out of options
yeah, when they run out of options.

there's the faith you can give or withhold
and then there's the one true faith
there's the revolution you came for
and the one you're eventually going to get.
and there's a road that starts right here and leads clear up to saskatchewan
and i brought a full tank and a '67 mustang.
and this is a song for your young women to whistle
while they're driving at high speeds down the highway

the wind up in the trees
the song on the wind
there's a mesage in the song
but the message is hopelessly complicated
and the words on water
and dissapeear before you write them down
but i, i brought the polaroid.
and this the song
and everyone's got to sing along
but it hasn't got a chorus
god damn it all.

yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
