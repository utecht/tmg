i remember the sound of your voice
but none of what you said.
i remember the burning in my body
and the buzzing in my head.
and i do remember your voice
smoothing over my only choice.

oh brave new world
that has such people in it.
oh brave new world
that has such people in it.

i can see the look on your face now
yes i can.
bright light dancing all along your eyes
and you covering your mouth up with your hand.
your bracelets jangled against your arm.
no harm intended
no harm.

oh brave new world
that has such people in it.
oh brave new world
brave.
