I, who have sat by thieves below the wall and walked among the lowest of the dead

All I know is that I'm in love with you
Even though you say that we are through
I know without your love I just cant go on
I wonder where our love has gone

Always thought you'd love me more and more
Never dreamed you'd ever let me go
I know without your love I just cant go on
I wonder where our love has gone

Now what did I do, and what did I say
Never could lead you to treat me this way
If I've been untrue, I'm willing to pay
Darling, if thats not enough I'll do anything you say

So darling, please, where-ever you may be
Hear my plea, hurry home to me
I know without your love I just can't go on
I wonder where our love has gone
