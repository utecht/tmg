All day, all day
Sweeping out the shards
Do what I have to do
Try to start anew
But I thought of you twice
Couldn’t help myself
I don’t know what I need
Clutching and fingering the rosary beads

But I try, try, try, but I know (try, try, try, but I know)
I can’t let go
Try, try, try, but I know (try, try, try, but I know)
I can’t let go

TV upstairs,
Leave it on all night
Do what I have to do
Add, subtract, and divide by 2
But my eyes light up, 
At cops and robbers time
I hope the bad guys win
I hope the good guys get their skulls bashed in

And I try, try, try, but I know (try, try, try, but I know)
I can’t let go
I can’t let go
