And the heat came down
I knew I was living in a long, long dream
when you fed me the black ice cream

and the heat rose up
I heard the loud loud buzzing of our son's go-kart
and the ice cream was blacker than the devil's heart
It was august the 19th, 1957
I fixed my eyes on you, fixed my eyes on you
