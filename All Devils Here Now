On humid evenings you have heard
Your neighbors making noises that you
Wonder for awhile about
And then put off investigating

Shrieks and squeals and high-pitched whines
And we
We are your neighbors

In hazy afternoons you've watched your neighbors come and go
And maybe stay away a day or two
And then return, appearing worse for wear
Scratched up and hollow-eyed
You tried your best to ignore us

You see us at the grocery store
You wonder what we're shopping for
We lean against the the Thermador
Eyes fixed firmly on the floor
Pomona's big as all outdoors
And we
We are your neighbors
