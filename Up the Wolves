There's bound to be a ghost 
At the back of your closet
No matter where you live
There'll always be a few things 
Maybe several things
That you're gonna find really difficult to forgive

There's gonna come a day 
When you'll feel better
You'll rise up free and easy on that day
And float from branch to branch
Lighter than the air
Just when that day is coming 
Who can say
Who can say

Our mother has been absent
Ever since we founded Rome
But there's gonna be a party 
When the wolf comes home

We're gonna commandeer 
The local airwaves
To tell the neighbors what's been going on
And they will shake their heads
And wag their bony fingers
In all the wrong directions
And by daybreak we'll be gone

I'm gonna get myself in fighting trim
Scope out every angle 
Of unfair advantage
I'm gonna bribe the officials
I'm gonna kill all the judges
It's gonna take you people years
To recover from all of the damage

Our mother has been absent
Ever since we founded Rome
But there's gonna be a party 
When the wolf comes home
