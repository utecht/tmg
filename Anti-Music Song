i saw you on tv
doing a bad imitation of van morrison
and i saw you on tv
doing a bad imitation of a second rate songwriter from the eighties named morissey
i never liked morrisey
and i don't like you.

i saw you tv, 
doing an imitation of an imitation of jimi hendrix
that's really pathetic
and i saw you on tv 
trying to figure out what brian jones would be like if he'd have lived 'til today
i can tell you myself
he'd be like brian wilson
i don't like brian wilson
and i don't like you
i don't like you.
