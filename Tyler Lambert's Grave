Steal the last across the country under moonlight soft and wet
And at the dead of night I hear from things you can't forget
spend daylight in dark tunnels where the demons rave
One day closer everyday to Tyler Lamber's grave

Shoplift when you have to, keep your visor low
If your hunger shames you never let them know
Feel your sadness lifting, ride it like a wave
That sets you gently down beside Tyler Lambert's grave

Fall into a pattern, never get unstuck
Anyone who can't relate should thank God for his love

Young man in a yellow tie, hair gel in his hair
No context for the picture, just kind of standing there
Tyler, step outside the shadow of your great catastrophe
Dream all night of freedom, never wake up free
