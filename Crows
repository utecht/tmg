well i went way out North Carolina way 
to that old graveyard where my great grandmother lay 
and the day was bright and i hadn't slept all night 
and they sold the place to some guys who were building graduate student housing
no one raised any objections 
they were knocking the headstones down
and the sun was high when i rolled into town
stood by a nameless hole in the ground
the air was sweet and hot
maybe it was the right grave,
maybe not
but the crows crows crows 
rose, rose, rose from the grave
Yeah the crows crows crows 
rose, rose, rose from the grave
