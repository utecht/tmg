i been drinking that coffee you sent me from thailand
i've been watching the lamps burn
i've been listening to the wind chime
i've been waiting my turn

and i'm coming to you
i am coming to you
i am coming to you

and i heated the milk until it boiled
and i drank it down
and i stepped outside 
and i checked my reflection in the rain
there were voices on the wind
winter coming on in
and i made myself up again, brand new

and i am broken and i am tired
and i'm coming to you with my mouth
dripping
