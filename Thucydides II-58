1, 2, 3 and 
Red face at noon, 
Stripped naked we can't get free, 
And doubling over in the street, 
Dozens just like me. 
Spreading like a rumor 
Spreading like a rumor. 

And the doctors come traveling house to house, 
And they visit the sick each day. 
Sit with them there until they're gone. 
Die quicker that way. 
Save who they save, 
On their way down to the grave . 
Spreading like a rumor, 
Spreading like a rumor. 

Run to the altars beg for shade, 
take to the high sea thousand strong. 
Hang on to your goodness when you can, 
Sweat it out all night long. 
And listen for the old melody, 
As it comes to me, 
On a high wind down from Ethiopia 
On a high wind down from Ethiopia 
On a high wind down from Ethiopia 
On a high wind down from Ethiopia
