When the sky opens wide
And the late winter rain goes wild
I don't like it
And I curse God to His face

And I say to myself
And to anyone else who will listen
Save yourselves
Or hang yourselves
But I am leaving this wretched place

But when you call down curses
On the God
That made you
You play hide and seek with trouble
Trouble's gonna find you too

When the ship finds land
And they throw me onto the sand
There's a guy
With a rifle
Waiting there

And I say
To nobody listening
"This is fine by me"
And ideas fly through my mind
The sweat cakes my hair

When you call down curses
On the God
That made you
You play hide and seek with trouble
Yes, the trouble's gonna find you too
