When I rose from a heavy sleep
I was stepping lightly
And I put on my gray suit
And the matching fedora

Ready to face the world
Fairly nearly ready
Came down the hallway
Looked in the mirror

Iâ€™m gonna break something
Iâ€™m gonna break something today
And sweep all the pieces away

And I stood before the mirror then
Like I was waiting for a phone call
Squinting like a lost traveler in a thick fog
But nothing clear came into view 
Except for you
Just off in the distant horizon
Something hidden in your hand

Iâ€™m gonna break something
Iâ€™m gonna break something today
And sweep all the pieces away

So I pulled my hat brim down over my eyes
And preened and posed and tried my new self on for size
Then I was out the door in the faint winter sunlight
Just a number in the crowd smiling at everyone

Oh but whoâ€™d smile back at a face like that?
Iâ€™m gonna break something
Iâ€™m gonna break something today
And sweep all the pieces away
