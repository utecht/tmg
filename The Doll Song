i've got seven little dolls
in a bag
and i tell the dolls my troubles
and the dolls say "nag! nag! nag! nag!
is that all you ever do?
is that all you're capable of?"
and i say to the little dolls
you have no compassion 
baby, i'm talking to inanimate objects over you
i'm talking to inanimate objects over you

i started reading the bible
I corinthians 13
where paul talks all about love
but i don't know what he means
because he says that love is kind
that hasn't been my experience
so i set the bible on the kitchen table
and yelled at it until i was unable yeah
i'm talking to inanimate objects over you
i'm talking to inanimate objects over you
i'm talking to inanimate objects over you
i'm talking to inanimate objects over you
