When they get me in a corner,
Break legs.
When I feel alone and useless,
Break legs.
If I can't claim the victory,
I'm taking you down with me.
Break legs, break legs, break legs.

When your enemies are closing in,
Break legs.
When they've got you under contract,
Break legs.
When they're filling out your card,
Go hard.
Break legs, break legs, break legs.

Tear my insides up,
With over-the-counter stuff.
Jump the turnbuckles and grimace,
Try to look tough.

When you get a reputation,
Break legs.
Broke no insubordination,
Break legs.
When the beer cups are raining down on you,
Do what they're paying you to do!
Break legs, break legs,
Break legs, break legs, break legs.
Break legs, break legs, break legs.
