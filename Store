in the five minutes worth of lost time that i had,
when i was passed out on the supermarket floor,
i saw you at the head of the heavenly chorus.
and i heard your song ringing all through the store.

in the five minutes when my broadcast got pre-empted,
i saw you touch down. you were no longer dead.
i was happy to see ya. i had lots of questions.
and i put my hand to the wound in your head.
ah, the blood!
all of that blood!
all of that warm blood flowing freely from you.

in the five minutes when i was dead to the world,
in a place far away from my friends and my home,
i saw you with a smile on your radiant face,
amidst all of the cans and the glass and the chrome.

and in those five minutes, my signal was jammed.
the frequencies that i received were so pure,
that i almost believed that the sight of the hole in your skull
was a thing that my heart could endure.
ah, the blood!
all of that blood!
all of that warm blood flowing freely from you!
