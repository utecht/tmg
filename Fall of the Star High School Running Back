Sophomore year
You rushed for an average 
Of 8 1/3 yards per carry
All eyes were on you

Junior year
You blew your knee out
 At an out-of-town game
Nowhere to go but 
Down, down, down
Nothing but the ground 
for you to fall to

By July
Youâ€™d made a whole bunch of brand new friends
People you used to look down on
And youâ€™d figured out
A way to make real money
Giving Ns to your friends 
And it felt stupendous:
Chrome spokes on your Japanese bike
But selling acid was a bad idea
And selling it to a cop was a worse one
And new laws said that 
17-year-olds could do federal time
You were the first one, 
so I sing this song for you
William Standaforth Donahue
Your grandfather rode the boat 
Over from Ireland, but
You made a bad decision or two.
