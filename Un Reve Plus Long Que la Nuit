On a Wednesday, on the 110
I felt the fever rise again
The weatherman east of here predicted rain
I hammered the words into my brain
That you were all I ever needed to get by

On the Long Island Expressway
About 4 AM on a Tuesday
Humidity like I'd never known before
And you sleeping like a baby
I could hear the engine roar
Somewhere high up above us in the New York sky
Where time means less than nothing, and no one ever dies
Someone knew that you were all there was worth needing
