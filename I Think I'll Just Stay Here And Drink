I could be holding you tonight
I could quit doing wrong and start doing right
You don't care about what I think
I think I’ll just stay here and drink.

You’re hurting me now, don't square the deal
At least you'll know the way I feel
I’ll take all the money in the bank
I think I’ll just stay here and drink.

Listen close and you will hear
That old juke box playing in my ear
Ain't no woman gonna change the way I think
I think I’ll just stay here and drink.

Hurting you now won't mean a thing
Since love ain't here it don't feel the pain
My mind ain't nothing but a total blank
I think I’ll just stay here and drink!
I think I’ll just stay here and drink!
I think I’ll just stay here and drink!
I think I’ll just stay here and drink!
I think I’ll just stay here and drink.
