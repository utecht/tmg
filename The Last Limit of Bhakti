let me serve you with my mind.
let me serve you with my mind.
let me leave this grieving sand and sky far behind.

let me serve you with my tongue.
let me serve you with my tongue.
let me say your name all day 'til my mouth goes numb.

when the sun comes up, open up the blind.
let me hear the machines grate gears, squeal and grind, yeah.

let me serve you 'til it's over.
let me serve you 'til it's all over.
when the world is giving your secrets all away, 
let me give you cover.

let me serve you with my body.
let me serve you with my body.
let me fight now until the end of time, 
the last limit.
yeah, yeah.
