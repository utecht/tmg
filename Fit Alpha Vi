I know you never asked for my opinion,
but I'd say that horse is crazy
I know what I think doesn't matter any more,
but I'd say his mind is gone
and I know you feel the same way,
even though you'd rather die than say it
I know you know what I know,
or you wouldn't be sleeping on the lawn

I heard the hooves crack the window,
saw the body come through
saw the big brown eyes flashing
I fell all over you
I got pressure bearing down
on me

There was a reason why I came here,
but I guess now it doesn't matter
I had a good, good, good, good reason,
but I guess now you couldn't care
There is a certain kind of feeling that you get
when you're totally helpless
and there's a different world waiting for me
when I lift my head up
from your thick, dark hair

I heard the hooves crack the window,
saw the body come through
saw the big nostrils flaring
I fell all over you
I got pressure bearing down
on me
