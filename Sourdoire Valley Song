Bang the small rocks on the big ones
Til the small ones are sharp and clean
Catch something, kill something
New blade cuts real keen

And then the grass grows up to cover up
The firepit and the forge
Half a world away from the Olduvai Gorge

Chew these roots for a toothache
Chew these ones for atmosphere
Dream the pleasant dreams that people dream
When they grow up down here

And then the grass grows up to cover up
The firepit and the forge
Half a world away from the Olduvai Gorge

Take care of the old man
See if he's in pain
Have somebody stay with him
Comfort him when he complains

Keep to ourselves mostly
Few friends and fewer closer friends
Lead a long life if you're lucky
Hope it never ends

And then the grass grows up to cover up
The firepit and the forge
Half a world away from the Olduvai Gorge
