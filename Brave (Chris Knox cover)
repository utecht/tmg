"Chris Knox, this is John Darnielle,out here in North Carolina, sending you all the power -- any reserves of power I might have that will help you up the hill.  But I know you can go there, because I used to watch you every night in 1995, when we were in the back of a van together, and think, 'That guy's got some power.'  So I know you have it and I know that you will climb up on your two magnificent feet..."

Color me red.  
Color me coal.
Wrap me in black. 
Or a snide acid green.

Tell me I'm bad.
Tell me I'm sick.
Scream out your hate.
Be obsessed and obscene.

Bind me with love.
Tie me with wire.
Wrap me in gauze,
And then watch as I bleed.

Poison your kiss.
Kill my desire.
Deliver me pain,
And ignore all my needs.

I will not change.
I will not alter.

Staple my eyes.
Thrill to my shins.
Gag me with lead,
And tear out all my nails.

Razor my tongue.
Sew up my mouth.
Feed me disease.
So my functioning fails.

I will not change.
I will not alter.
For I am Man,
And I am strong.

Do all this to me.
I just don't care.
Blood is my wine,
And fear is my friend.

But please do not say
I am not hard.
Don't say I can yield.
Don't say I can bend.

I will not change.
I will not alter.
For I am man,
And I am strong.

I cannot sway.
I cannot falter.
I must be Man.
I can't be wrong.

It's your fucking fault.
You and your doubts
Made me like this,
Colored me Man, Colored me Man.
