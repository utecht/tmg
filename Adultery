there's a mean streak in the sky
on the morning when you come by.
and you ask me "would i?"
and i say i would.
and it's an ill wind that does nobody good.

and i should've known that you'd come my way.
by the dogs sprawled out sleeping in the driveway
windows open audibly around the neighborhood,
and it's an ill wind that does nobody good.

and you touched my hand.
and the sun beats down.
ineffective warnings all over the ground,
and i'm standing on the same spot where your husband stood.
and it's an ill wind that does nobody good.
