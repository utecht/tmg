long rain, it must be june again.
warm air, and it's so warm down there.
i'm coming soon, open the blinds.
your friends all tell me that you've lost your mind.
i don't believe them.
                                                                                
the seashore, i don't want to see it anymore.
the bus runs smoothly,
the back window's open and the burning air cools me
hold your breath,
your friends all swear you're one step away from death
i don't belive them.
                                                                                
mmm, here it comes.
my head is throbbing and my hands are numb.
it's you.
what was i thinking?
what should i do?
your eyes are open and it's more than i can take
my friends all told me i was making a mistake
i don't believe them.
