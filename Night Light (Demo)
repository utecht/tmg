Pull my mask so tight
Till it pinches my skin
Nerves strung so high
I am a mandolin
Jenny calls from Montana
Sheâ€™s only passing through
Probably never see her again in this life, I guess
Not sure what Iâ€™m gonna do

Plug a night light in
Leave the porch light on
Because the small, dark corners
Have designs on me	
Live like an outlaw
Clutching gold coins in his claw

Room full of ambitious, young policemen
Everybody trying to make his mark
I was a red dot blinking on a screen up overhead
And then the room went dark

Dream of waking up someday
And wanting you less than I do
This is a dream though
Itâ€™s never gonna come true

Plug a night light in
Leave the porch light on
Because the small, dark corners
Are establishing their colonies
Live like an outlaw
Clutching gold coins in his claw

Canâ€™t ever set aside the sweetness
Of the days before the crews put up the border
But those days are gone now
Everybody run for cover
Think about Montana when I close my eyes
Probably Jennyâ€™s headed east
Count a couple stray hopes out loud
May their numbers one day be increased

Plug a night light in
Leave the porch light on
Because the small, dark corners
Have been lying in wait
Live like an outlaw
Clutching gold coins in his claw
