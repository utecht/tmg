Wake up all the birds of prey
Dig your tools out from the clay 
Seal the exits of your room 
Watch the cactus flowers bloom

Send my regards to the boys down on the corner (x2)

Build a house from sticks and mud
Listen to the poison singing in your blood 
Fill yourself a (?) to drink
Carve your initials in the bathroom sink

Send my regards to the boys down on the corner (x2)

The city of Norwalk in my dreams 
Rises like Atlantis from a watery grave 
Burn the things you have to burn
Save all the people you're supposed to save

Send my belongings to the drop box in Tijuana
Send my regards to the boys down on the corner
