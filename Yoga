We had our passports out
And the kits to fix 'em up with.
And the hurricane lamp
threw our shadows on the ceiling.
I watched 'em box with one another up there
Punch and Judy.
It was lovely, it was awful, 
It was that kind of feeling, 
when you said it was real sure,
and there was nothing standing in our way.
And the lie ran off and hid itself
in the alleys all across Bombay.

I saw you knock the lamp over
while reaching for the scissors
and I wondered how we'd ever
get by without it.
And you fell into my arms then,
sweet and gentle.
Poison in the water
little doubt about it.
And you said that one of us
would be all alone someday.
And the truth of it echoed
inexhaustibly up and down the thoroughfares
all across Bombay.
