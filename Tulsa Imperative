Your mama's failed wheat field 
Was a good place to lie down together
Three weeks deep into the guts of summer
We sweat like hogs and I felt light as a feather

I saw a disk-like object 
reflected in your eyes
And the noise grew louder
As we looked up to the skies

And the sleek silver body 
had lights along the side
And the sleek silver body 
had lights all underneath

I remember the warm air
Blowing our faces
Yeah, I remember the heat
Running through me

There was no one worth telling
There was nothing we could do
Yeah, and I was real quiet as I lifted the keys from the kitchen table
I was looking right at you

And your hand brushed against mine
Yeah, and it shook me inside 
As all along the night sky
I watched our futures collide

And the car's new headlights
Cut through the darkness
As the oil dripped silently to the pavement underneath

I remember the warm air
Burning our faces
Yeah I remember the heat
Running through me
