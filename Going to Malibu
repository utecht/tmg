when we meet on neutral ground,
i can't belive how good you look.
and the thoughts that race around my mind,
fill a long unreadable book and

i can feel the waves,
i can sense the continents eroding,
you say you know why i called you here,
but you couldn't have any way of knowing, so
that's not true.
that's a mean thing to say.
that's a damnable lie.
that's a damnable lie.

looking at you, and i don't know
what it is i see
and i know you're changing, almost indetectably.

and i see a ship off the shore
and i imagine it sinking.
and you smile and you say that you know
what it is that i'm thinking.
that's not true.
that's a rotten thing to say.
that's a damnable lie.
that's a damnable lie.
