Outside the Federal District
30 miles away
We saw the sunlight strike the sundial
We saw the sundial disappear
Shooting off the river's body
Little tributaries flowing
Wild amaranth growing

It was quiet for a minute
Then a plane passed overhead
It was flying far too low to the ground
I felt the wind brush by my hair
Shooting off the river's body
Little tributaries glowing
Wild amaranth growing

Your hair was getting dirty
I felt your fingers stroke my ribs
I felt you brushing up against me
I let my concentration slip
I swear the new day
I swear the new day's coming
Wild amaranth growing
