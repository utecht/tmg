the rain didn't come for one calendar year
so when the man with the sunflower seeds in his hand came here
we sent him away, we sent him away

the rain didn't come for twelve months more
so when the man with the seed catalogs darkened our door
we sent him away (4x)

and i know you're waiting for the ironic ending
and i know you're waiting for the punchline
and i know you're waiting for the rain to come by
so am i (4x)
