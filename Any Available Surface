I waved at you when you hit the disappearing point
Turned in for the night the next day around ten
I caught the sweet scent of your hair on my pillowcase
Felt so much in love, I felt like myself again

Someday the only thing I want to rely upon
Is any available surface that you've rested your head on.

Back in the cave I traced the arc of our awakening
Shimmering down in the darkness like hidden gold
And I said my secret to myself out loud again
We may live to see miracles if our faith can hold

Someday the only thing I want to rely upon
Is any available surface that you've rested your head on.
