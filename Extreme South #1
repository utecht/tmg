In the little house
On the beach
Underneath the dwarf peach tree
I got Coca-cola on my tongue
Yeah a sweet taste in my mouth
Born down past Venezuela
Extreme south

South American red-capped woodpecker
In the high trees drumming
In the wet sand
I see you coming
Comfort burning in your eyes
Yeah a sweet taste in my mouth
Born down around the horn
Extreme south
