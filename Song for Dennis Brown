on the day that Dennis Brown's 
lung collasped
spring rain was misting down on Kingston
and down at the harbor
local cops were intercepting
an inbound shipment
and for a while there it was chaos
as they handcuffed and then ruffed up
some sailors

on the day my lung collapses
it's not gonna be much different

on the day that Dennis Brown's
habbits caught up with him
school children sang in choir
and out behind the Chinese resturants
guys were jumping into dumpsters
and the stench was overbearing
but they were past the point of caring

on the day my habits catch up with me
i'll be down among the jumpers

and when the birds come home in spring
we will fill them up with buckshot
and jets of contaminated blood
will cloud the rivers and the lakes

it took all the coke in town
to bring down Dennis Brown

on the day my lung collapses
we'll see just how much it takes
