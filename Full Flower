i saw the ceiling spin.
and i saw the room shift.
and i watched the television flicker.
and i let my mind drift.
i would give anything in the world up for you,
but i will not stop.

i saw the blossom form.
and i saw the screen glow.
and i let my arm fall to my side.
and i took one step back.
i would give anything in the world up for you,
but i will not stop.
