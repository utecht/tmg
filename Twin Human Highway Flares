you turned to me and asked me if i'd always be your boy 
as we drove across the river into western illinois 
and on the railroad bridge, half a mile of solid steel 
wheels were spitting out sparks, scraping at the rails 
wind in your hair all right sunset spilling through the rear window 
your white t-shirt hugging your shoulders, beaded with sweat 
on the day that i become so forgetful that all of this melts away 
i will burn all the calanders that counted the years down to such a worthless day 

as we walked across the parking lot toward the motel office 
we were walking with a benediction on us 
light was everywhere, the building stood against the sky 
like a monument to desperation 2 floors high 
a mile and a half from the river we went back to the car to get our overnight bags sunset spilling through your earrings, all over your body 
when we shut the motel door behind us, we knew we'd hit the motherlode 
on the day that i forget you, i hope my heart explodes
