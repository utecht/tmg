when i was twelve years old, they put me on the throne
when i was twelve years old, they made me king
from the ocean south of here to the northern hemisphere, they gave me everything 
now i'm thirteen, and no one takes me seriously
now i'm thirteen, and they're trying to take away control
i don't know how stupid you all think i am
but as sure as flowers grow along the western wall, some heads are going to roll
yeah
