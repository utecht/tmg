The most remarkable thing about coming home to you is the feeling of being in motion again: its the most extraordinary thing in the world.

I have two big hands and a heart pumping blood and a 1967 Colt .45 with the busted safety catch.

The world shines as I cross the Macon county line going to Georgia.

The most remarkable thing about you standing in the doorway is that it's you and that you are standing in the doorway and you smile as you ease the gun from my hand,  I am frozen with joy right where I stand.

The world throws its light underneath your hair, forty miles from Atlanta, this is nowhere, going to Georgia.

The world shines as I cross the Macon county line going to Georgia.
