in sicily, it's awfully hot
and where we were most decidedly not
so i looked around
i saw heaven coming down
around you

in washington, it's cold as ice
and we were warm in the arms of christ himself
i took a long look at you face
i saw the angel take his place
beside you

there's monsoons
in cashmir
i was worried that you'd dissapear
i touched your arm just to be on the safe side
and the world broke apart and fell off by the wayside
next to you
