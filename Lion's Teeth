The king of the jungle
Was asleep in his car
When your chances fall in your lap like that
You've gotta recognize them for what they really are
Nobody in this house
Wants to own up to the truth
I crawl in shotgun and reach into his mouth
And grab hold of one long sharp tooth

And hold on
For dear life
I hold on

Well of course he wakes up
His paw hits the horn
I am gonna regret
The day that I was born
And then mom
Rushes out to the driveway
My sister too
Everyone's screaming
I am dreaming of you

I hold on
For dear life
I hold on

And my arms get sore
And my palms start to sweat
And the tears roll down my face
Till my cheeks are hot and red and soaking wet

In come the cops
They blowtorch the doors
I start wailing
The lion roars
There's no good way to end this
Anyone can see
There's this great big you
And little old me

And we hold on
For dear life
We hold on
We hold on
