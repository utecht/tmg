try to hide down in the darkness
get accustomed to our shapes
reined in 'til next week at the earliest
go through an old box full of betamax tapes

pull the blankets up to my neck
and the screen began to glow
i cried real tears when they beat chuck norris down
wait here in the shadows 'til the shadows let me go

and treat each crushing moment like a gift
and wait for the fog to lift

pretend i'm waiting for a notice
from someone somewhere far away
sit here and break things while i'm waiting
as day gives way to day gives way to day gives way to day

but though i try to let the shadows mask my movements
they're never gonna hide me like they used to
i watch the delta force save everybody from that plane on fire
i was watching wishing i had not lost track of you

i treat each crushing moment like a gift
and wait for the fog to lift
