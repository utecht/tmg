a bird you would've liked brought the sky down,
but it was useless to see it without you around.
and in the unstoppable camera of my mind's eye,
i saw you and some foreign guy.

and i could hear you voice ringing.
and i could hear you singing.
from all the way across the country in palm springs,
i can hear you now.

your laughter tore through the new jersey night,
and i can't stand it, but i'm alright.
stood out on the balcony and i took a look around
and a bird you would've loved the sight of
brought the sky down.

and i can hear you voice ringing.
and i can hear you singing.
from all the way across the country in palm springs,
i can hear you now.
