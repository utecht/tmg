I have a hand disfigured by snakebite.
I have a couple of things that I really like
and I am heading your way all the time.

I'm going to move all my vital organs
to someplace outside my body.
The wiring is something you would not believe.

I feel no pain as I float across your ceiling, and I --
I have no shame.
I am in a thousand rooms all at the same time.
Yeah and I have a glass
filled with water and light, and I feel good tonight.
I am climbing up this mountain.
You can watch me. You can watch me.
