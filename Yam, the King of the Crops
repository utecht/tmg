felt sick, felt good
the heat burns, old wood
muscles in my arms pump like machines
the jericho palm tree is plush and green

bright sun, the new day
i felt sick in a good way
felt the fever climb when you came down
all the way across town

and you brought me a plate of sweet potatoes

sun fading overhead
the sunset, bright red
your green eyes, your smooth walk
fresh tomato, celery stalk, you cook
pot of pari basmati rice
i felt good, you looked nice
you stood like galatea, over me
fried garlic, kim chee
and you brought me a plate of sweet potatoes
