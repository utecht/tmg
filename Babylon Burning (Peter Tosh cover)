Babylon burning, Babylon burning, Babylon burning
They have no water

Fire fire, fire fire, fire fire
They have no water

Where you gonna run to? 
Where will you run to?
Where will you run to?
Days without mercy

I saw the fire, I saw the fire, 
I could see the fire
They had no water

Babylon burning, Babylon burning, Babylon burning
They have no water
No!
