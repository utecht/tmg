lay down just a little while
honey lemon-chamomile
very soon the plane's coming in.

one hour worth of quicksand
the glass warm against your hand
very soon the airplane will take me away.

i will nuzzle up against you and then,
i will never see you again.
fires burning,
the world's turning around.

words that lose their meanings and then swell up like balloons,
very soon the taxi will come.
all the lies you told me can no longer hold me.
very soon the taxi will take me away.

i will forget how you've done me wrong,
how you've strung me along.
fires burning,
learning to breathe.
