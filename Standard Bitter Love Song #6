i don't like what i've turned into
there's a hole in my chest in the spot that you wormed out through
they say it's on the mend,
but it hurts me when i bend, yeah.

and i saw you down at angie's place
that rippling smile on your perfect face
well it really doesn't suit you.
when i see it i want to shoot you, sorry.

and i don't like what you said to me.
i don't like what you said to me.
but i guess i'll have to deal with it
let the bullet hit me and i just reel with it,
isn't that right?
isn't that right?
isn't that right?
isn't that right?
