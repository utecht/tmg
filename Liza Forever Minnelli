There's the part you've braced yourself against and then there's the other part
Steal up inclining northward streets with some weird sickness in the dark

Saw your name on the sidewalk saw your brave face in my mind
If you're gonna sit next to the dealer you get to bet blind

Never get away never get away I am never ever gonna get away from this place
Lay down on the streets my eyes toward the sun your star next to my face

The compasses I came into this world with never really worked so good
Gentle shadows spilling down the hills up on Mulholland at Ledgewood

Turn back turn back find someone to tell your secrets to
Dream past an old hotel on Ivy and seconds later i saw you

Never get away never get away I am never ever gonna get away from this place
Lay down on the streets my eyes toward the sun your star next to my face

Let the camera track me from the footlights to the wings
Let me set aside an hour or two in memory of sweet things

Regrind the lens again and again and again and again but still the picture fips
Anyone here mentions "Hotel California" dies before the first line clears his lips

Never get away never get away I am never ever gonna get away from this place
Lay down on the streets my eyes toward the sun your star next to my face
