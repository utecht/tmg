Now, meanwhile downstairs
I'm setting up shop
A little too proud
To let the matter drop
And I can hear you up there
Isn't it romantic?
You're huffing and puffing
Rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic
And I reach for a glass
Of cool water, drawn
From the rivers of Babylon

And meanwhile outside
The stars've come out
And the humid summer air
Pulls at the ring in my snout
And you stand at your window, looking down
And I spread wide my arms
Jump if you want to jump
Jump if you want to
The water's warm
I know
I know, cos I've been swimming
Blindly along
Through the rivers of Babylon
