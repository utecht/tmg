two weeks later you asked me what did i do
right after i got the great big brush-off from you.
well i checked my pulse and i caught my breath.
and i, i guess you know what happens next.
i sat down and i drank my malted milk.
i sat down and i drank my malted milk.

you, you say, you say i'm easily appeased.
but you, you don't know the feeling that shoots me.
with a tall glass of malted milk
cold as ice, smooth as silk.
i sit down and i try real hard to forget 
that you, you and i ever met.

yesterday you came over
and you found me stretched out on the sofa.
and you said you were gonna call a medic
'cause i looked so pathetic.
well i ain't there smiling brightly staring at you.
malted milk in my hand, still as a statue.
i sat down and i drank my malted milk.
i sat down and i drank my malted milk.
i sat down and i drank my malted milk.
i sat down and i drank my malted milk.
