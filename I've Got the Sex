crushing strawberries one by one
watching the juice drip down
two and a half months ahead of schedule
the leaves on the trees are turning brown
we got ready for winter, as the sun rose up in the sky
there was something almost soothing in the hard to define
note of terror in your eye

watching the strawberries lose their shape 
as the wind blew through the elm tree
the wind was far too cold for the middle of april
and you reached out your hand to me
it was good to feel your hand in mine
it was good to know you felt the pull too
I scooped up a palmful of strawberry pulp
and smeared it all over you

the wild strawberries drove me on, as I lapped them up off of your skin
and I could feel your basal body temperature rise as the cold came in
hey hey
