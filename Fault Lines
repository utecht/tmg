down here where the heat's so fine
I'll drink to your health and you drink to mine
as we try
to make the money we scored out in vegas hold out for a while
we drink
vodka from russia
we got chocolates from belgian
we have our strawberries flown in from england
but none of the money we spend
seems to do as much good in the end
I got a cracked engine block
both of us do
got a house, the jewels, the italian racecar
they don't make us feel better about who we are
I got termites in the framework
so do you
down here where the watermelon grows so sweet
where I worship the ground underneath of your feet
we are experts
in the art of frivilous spending
it's gone on like this 
for three years I guess
and we're drunk all the time
and our lives are a mess
and the deathless love we swore to protect with our bodies
is stumbling across it's bleak ending
but none of the rage in our eyes
seems to finish it off where it lies
I got sugar in the fuel lines
both of us do
got a fight and the lies that we both love to tell
fail to send our love to it's reward down in hell
I got pudding for a backbone
but so do you

La la la La, hey hey.
