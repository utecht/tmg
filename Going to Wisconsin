there was the sound of a lake boiling over 
on that day. 
everyone said just to sit still, 
but the thickening air got in my way. 

so the hooks been baited now, 
yeah, the cheese is on the water. 
yeah, all the water's been cleansed of all impurities, 
but now it really doesn't matter. 
let's go! let's go! 

wisconsin bound. 
wisconsin bound. 
wisconsin bound. 
yeah, wisconsin bound. 

the bottom of the boat was a hot-plate come alive. 
but the boat wasn't real, and this is how I feel: 
you don't know where you are, until you arrive. 
and the frogs sang out from the distant banks. 
and you say you need me in california, 
but, no thanks! 

wisconsin bound. 
wisconsin bound. 
wisconsin bound. 
yeah, wisconsin bound. 

let's go!
