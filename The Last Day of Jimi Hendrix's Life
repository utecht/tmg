on the last day of his life 
jimi hendrix woke up
and made his way down the hall
he adjusted the knobs in the shower
till the water came out 
just the way he liked it
it was hot but not too hot
it was hot 
but not too hot

on the last afternoon of his life
jimi hendrix went to the kitchen
and he got himself a glass of water
he put four ice cubes into the glass
there is nothing like cold water
there is nothing
