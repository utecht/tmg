selling new flowers,
outrageously cheap.
freshly cut daisies,
twenty five cents each.
you loved me when you could keep your losses down
but winter's coming around now.
now, now, now.

the girl at the flower shop
is kind and young.
she made accurate change for me.
i let the change come.
you loved me when it was cheap to do so.
can you feel the cold wind blow now?
now, now now.
