i hung pictures of you from every lamp post in town
as the humidity climbed into numbers i don't care to repeat
the air was heavy and the sky was alive
and the pacific starlight train wasn't due in till 11.45

chorus
i thought about how cold you must be
i thought about things i thought that i'd soon be forgetting
i thought of you up in canada as the lightning storm lit up
all downtown redding

there were teenagers in mini-trucks coming around every corner
you can taste the adrenaline, coming out through their skin
i came to the well-lit doorway of a sheet music store
saw my face in the glass. sat down in the doorway and i settled in.
