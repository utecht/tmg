I can't stand it when you tell our infant son
That he was born beneath a bad sign
And I can't stand it when he smiles up at you
Just because you're his mother
And I can't stand the bitter thing that I've become
Between the four walls that hold up our ceiling
And I wonder when the house gets real quiet
Who between us will be the first one to give into the feeling
And I know you don't want me to hurt you tonight
And I, I don't want you to hurt me the way you do

I can't stand it when you put the boy to bed
And you sing him those songs I used to sing to you
Yeah, I can't stand to hear you sing those songs
When you know you don't mean them
And I can't stand the way my body still remembers
How much we used to mean to one another way back when
And I can't stand going back to seek the shelter of your arms
And then I can't stand it again
And I know you don't want me to hurt you tonight
And I, I don't want you to hurt me the way you do
