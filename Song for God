Neighbor kids running across the front yard this evening
sun going down, wind gathering strength
the state I live in is the largest of its kind
it takes two days or better to drive across its length

If you try to come and find me, I will know you're coming
there's an old fallout shelter I can hide in
I won't even be able to hear their hoofbeats
when the horsemen ride in

another mild winter - time seems to stand still
the sky swallows up the city like a tent
tiny breezes razor patterns in the dust
no way of saying what they're supposed to represent

I have come to where I've come to now
always abiding in you
if you try to find me now I'll be invisible to everything
when the horsemen come riding on through
