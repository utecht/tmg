"he who casts the stone can't ever do so on his own
it takes a crowd to drown a witch"
so he said to us when he wriggled free
and got the gun from me
standing before us his cracking voice rising in pitch

and then the blood
that's been spilling from his eyes
soaks through the bandages that are wrapped around his face
and just before he walks backwards through the wall
he pivots 45 degrees to face us all
and he says "let him who has eyes to see 
take a good look at me
i'm a mylar sheet hanging in the sun"

Claude Rains in all his glory
is not arrayed like these
who have come to walk before us
rising from their knees
fighting back against their captors
calling down the curse
like this man who's substance is malleable
screaming out chapter and verse

and then the blood 
that's been spilling from his eyes
soaks through the bandages that are wrapped around his face
and just before he walks backwards through the wall
he pivots 45 degrees to face us all
and he says "let him who has eyes to see 
take a good look at me
i'm a mylar sheet hanging in the sun"
