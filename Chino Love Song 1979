and the may sun shone down on california. 
and the strawberries grew fat and full 
and thick and red and as big as your fist 
and the traffic on riverside drive was thin 
but by no means non-existant. 

when I saw you against the soda machine. 
I saw you leaning there. 

and your hand in the basket 
was nimble-fingered, and red finger-nailed 
and it made me remember the sunflower that popped-up outside my window one 
morning in norwalk 
it was bright yellow and it was real inviting 
and I almost forgot that it was an intruder 

and I saw you against the soda machine. 
I saw you leaning there. 

I saw you against the soda machine. 
I saw you leaning there.
