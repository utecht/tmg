wind out of Oklahoma this morning
smelled like blood and smoke
and the crows discussed their future
in the branches of their
Louisiana live oak
the limbs are strong and heavy
and its leaves are all aglow
and the branches brush the upper air
but the roots reach down
to where the bad people go

and what will i do with you
pink and blue
true gold
nine days old

nice new clothes on you
and an old cardboard produce box for a cradle
i mash some bananas
in a coffee cup
and i fÃªte you there
at the kitchen table
crows outside complaining
about the finer points of local politics
strange wind all full of new smells
rust and fur and reception sticks

and what will i do with you
pink and blue
true gold
nine days old
