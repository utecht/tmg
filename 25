in the front seat at around four in the morning,
something came down without much warning.
it was bright and shiny and real nice
and it prepared us both for the sacrifice.
i know what it is and i know what it means,
and it's got wings.
i know what it is and i know what it means,
and it's got wings.

in the front seat, you know what i mean.
love came down
bright and hot and pure and clean and ready,
ready for the kill.
and i'll get ready.
but hold me hand.
would you please hold me steady?
i know what it is and i know what it means,
and it's got wings.
i know what it is and i know what it means,
and it's got wings.
