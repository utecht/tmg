spoken: this is like the oldest Mountain Goats song in existence...

for days i watched you from my place.
a thousand miles away in space.
remebering you body, how it it turned me into what i am now.
i have not broken any laws to work toward my stupid cause.
i can see you now from where i am.
i can see you completely.

i planted hedges of hydrangia
because you were going to pennsylvania.
and i didn't know what else to do.
i wanted to put my hands on you.
i wanted to tell you everything,
but i eneded up here orbiting.
i can see you now,
i can feel you now.
from where i am, i can see you completely.

i went into your room,
it got so crazy in there, the air turned hot.
and i saw them, but i didn't read your letters.
i will never bleed like i used to bleed again.
i can't bleed like normal men.
but i can see you, my heart beats like a magic drum.
from where i am, i can see you completely.
