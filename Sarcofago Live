We were hungry, there was no food
We were restless, there were too many things to do
So we gathered in a concrete room
Eyes up at you

And in a small room in Brazil
We were waiting 
And in a small room in Brazil
We were waiting

We were howling like dogs
We were feeling the full brunt of the age
Guys from our neighborhood looking down at us
All of you all of you rage rage rage

And in a small room in Brazil
We were waiting 
And in a small room in Brazil
We were waiting
