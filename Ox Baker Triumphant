I will rise from the swamp
Where they dumped my private plane
I'll be clutching the life preserver
In my teeth
And I will find the highway
And I will flag down a truck
Worry lines on my forehead
Blank stare underneath

And when I come back to town
I'm gonna cast my burden down
A little worse for wear
Practically walking on air

I will thank my ride
And claw my way back inside
To the guts of the building
Where my enemies hide in the dark like roaches
And I will signal the camera crew
And everyone will do what he's been trained how to do
Sweat dripping from my face
As my moment approaches

Click your heels
Count to three
I bet you never expected me
A little worse for wear
Practically walking on air
