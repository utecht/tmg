red red, red everywhere
bright red all along the thin canvas wall
i stepped outside, for a little air
i stepped outside to get away from it all
i went out to the front, and saw the purple sky
making jokes about my condition

i am going for a walk
i'll be back in half an hour
watch over the children
i'll be back in half an hour
hey hey la la la
hey hey la la la
