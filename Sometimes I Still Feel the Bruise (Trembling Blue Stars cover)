This is just to say hello
And to let you know
I think of you from time to time
I know  I never really knew you
But somehow I miss you
Wish that you'd stayed in my life

Making contact gets harder
As the silence grows longer
And isn't it only me
Who'd like us to see eachother
How I would hate to be a bother
The way we left it was you'd ring

I'm under no illusion
As to what I meant to you
But you made an impression
Sometimes I still feel the bruise

Now and then I'll stumble on
What I've misplaced but never lost
An ache I first felt long ago
Though you've appeared and disappeared
Throughout these past few years
I'd be surprised if you now showed

Making contact gets harder
As the silence grows longer
And why would you think of me
When you were not the one in love
When you were not the dreamer
When you were just the dream

I'm under no illusion
As to what I meant to you
But you made an impression
Sometimes I still feel the bruise
