Two tall glasses of sweet ice tea
Underneath the sweet gum tree
And the love we once nurtured
You and me
Disintregating violently
Stick your tongue out
Catch the peices as they drift down the air
I am
Too slow to catch them all
Not too far gone to care

Two slow summer hours
Spent picking at the bones
Figuring the interest on delinquent loans
Speaking in sad and mournful tones
Trying to squeeze tears out of 
Mute stones
Wet your finger
Place it toward the wind
Feel disaster in the air
We are far too slow to out run it now
Not too far gone to care
