baseball season will be starting soon.
but we have no baseball team here.
i've got a house right on the river.
i can see arkansas from where i am.

the dogs are gathered.
and the birds are chattering
and the sun is setting on memphis.
and the sun is setting on memphis.

medicine bottle collection on the window sill
shakes when the cars go past on interstate fifty-five
you are standing above me.
you've washed your face with that apricot scrub again.
i'm glad i'm alive
and your skin is warming up.
and my skin is warming up.
and the sun is setting on memphis.
and the sun is setting on memphis.
