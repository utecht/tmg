they wanted me to be a lawyer
they wanted me to work in a machine shop
they wanted me to be a desinger
but i came out on top
i'm a fireman
i'm a fireman

stand and watch the smoke
see the flames rise to the sky
stand and watch the flames climb higher
feel the smoke get into my eyes
i'm a fire man
i'm a fire man
