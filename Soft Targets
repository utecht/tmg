you cry when you get drunk
and i can't find the right things to say
sooner or later you'll start breaking plates
and i'll do what i can to stay out of your way

there is nobody innocent here
i got more blood on my hands than you do
it's you and it's me and the baby makes three
yeah but we've got our love to carry us through
we've got our love to carry us through

i cry when i'm hungry
something is wrong with my brain
and the ghost of future's awake in the attic
he moans and he wails as he rattles his chain

we embrace on the floor in the kitchen
emissaries from neighboring lands
when i hunt down the vampire who did this to us
i will rip out his heart with my hands
i will rip out his heart with my hands
