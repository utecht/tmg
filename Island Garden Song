i will sail to the far shore,
and i will chop a hole in the hull too big to repair,
and i will turn the soil with my hands,
and i will make my home there.
my garden will grow so high.
my garden will grow so high.
that i will be completely hidden.

i will go where i will go,
and i will jettison all dead weight,
and i will use these words for kindling,
and i will sleep by the garden gate.
my garden will grow so high.
my garden will grow so high.
that i will be completely hidden.
