Come and stay with me as long as you like
I live outside of town where the straight highway curves
For three years I lived next door to the airport
So nothing you can say to me can get on my nerves
Stay 'til you feel your legs underneath you again
I've got room in my house for you. 

I got a Kenmore single room window unit air conditioner
Cools down the place in the full heat of day
A family of possums have made their home underneath the front steps
They are majestic in their own beady eyed homely way
Stay 'til you can breathe like normal people do
I've got room in my house for you

They tore down the airport in 1981
This is where I came when I ran out of places to run
Come, come, come and stay with me out here away from things
Come and stay with me where the sky's real clear
I live way out where no one believes anybody could live
The sky's purple from six in the evening 'til midnight out here
Stay 'til the world goes down in flames
I've got room, room in my house for you.
