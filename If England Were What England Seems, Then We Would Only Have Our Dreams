I told you I was never going back
I was trying to breath evenly
When the phone stopped ringing 
For the first time in a long time
And you flashed that smile at me
Then you opened up the window
Felt the air roll in
In the place where the world stops forever
In the space where your body begins

You were staring down at the street below
There was nobody there
They built a fire down there in the alley
I saw the fires rising everywhere
Then you opened up the window
The north wind began to blow
We were just a few short hours
From something really special and
I hear you singing songs in low
