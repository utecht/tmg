Sun twinkling on the river this evening
The taste of chocolate on my tongue
Darkness climbing up the ladders to the sky
Rung by agonizing rung

Heard firecrackers popping next door
Wondered what it was I'd bargained for
And I laid quiet on the floor 
And you were not here

Let me be a witness
Let me walk out on the edge
The sun refused to shine on my back yard today
Darkness climbing up the house
Coming through the window ledge

I heard the firecrackers bursting on the sidewalk
Heard you talking that baby talk 
Saw the black lights again and I felt a shock
When you were knocking
When you were knocking
