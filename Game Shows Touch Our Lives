dug up a fifth of hood river gin, 
and that stuff tastes like medicine
but i'll take it, it'll do.
on the couch in the living room all day long,
music on the television playing our song.
i'm in the mood,
the mood for you.

turn the volume up real high, 
all of that money, look at it fly.
and you smoking like a chimney.
shadows crawled across the livingroom's length, 
i held onto you with a desperate strength, with everything. with everything in me.

i handed you a drink of the lovely little thing on which our survival depends .
people say friends dont destroy one another, what do they know about friends?

thunder clouds forming, cream white moon, everything's gonna be okay soon. 
maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day.

carried you up the stairs that night, 
all of this could be yours, if the price is right.
 i heard cars headed down to oblivion up on the expressway.

your drunken kisses as light as the air, 
maybe everything that falls down, eventually rises.
our house sinking into disrepair, 
ah, but look at this showroom filled with fabulous prizes.
