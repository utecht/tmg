i remembered you.
i remembered where you'd come from.
i remembered you.
i remembered where you've gone.

in the shifting neon air,
saw the colors of the revolution everywhere
blood royal.

i remembered you.
i remembered all the things you said.
i remembered the shape of your face.
i let the thought go to my head.

in the iron blue dawn,
i felt power coming on.
blood royal.
