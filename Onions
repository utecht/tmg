the last white slabs of snow
melted off seven weeks ago.
and the geese are headed north again
through the tightening sky,
and i can feel my heart in my throat again
new onions growing in the ground.


the cows come gingerly out of the barn,
and when they see that the ground is warm,
they pick up a little speed,
it makes me feel so good,
and i feel it rushing down my throat -- fresh blood,
i head out onto the earth,
its cold heart is melting,
i don't know if i can stand it.
springtime's coming, that means you'll be coming back around.
new onions growing underground, underground.
