if you ever get money, print books
if you ever get money, print books
if nobody reads them, that's ok
if nobody hears what you have to say, that's ok
 
if you sell a few books, buy land
if you sell a few books, buy land
if no one come to visit you that's all right
if no one comes to visit you and you get lonely at night, that's all right
 
when you've built up your small house, settle in
when you've built up your strong home, settle in
take down the books that you once put away
wait for the memories to bloom, in your cold room.
