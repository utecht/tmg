you say it's too cold over there anyway
it's far too cold.
i'm going to france.
and i'm taking you with me.

wild berries, wild sheep
you know you want to see them.
and i'm going to france.
and i'm taking you with me.

we always said one day we were going there.
well, i don't know about you,
but i keep my promises.
and i'm going to france.
and i'm taking you with me.
