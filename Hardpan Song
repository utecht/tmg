The daylily withers
The heat kills off all the grain
Just when you think 
It's never gonna rain
The rain comes, the rain comes
It floods the town, kills everybody in it

The dog runs in circles
Parolees all skip town
Heat goes on forever and ever and ever
Shows no signs of slowing down
Then the rain comes, the rain comes
It shows no signs of stopping.
