lob some spit at the window
watch it drop down the pane
it's only the guilty who concern themselves
with clearing their names

you bring tidings of hope, false tidings
when you come here
there's two friends who did me wrong that you're protecting
it's so clear

and when you speak it's those two who speak through you
who'll speak for me?
the burning and the electricity

sun goes down San Francisco
friends are hard to find
chew them up just as quick as I can find them
try to clear my mind

remember hours at the table
gauze flight light easing through
if there's one thing that I'm not going to do tonight
it's die for you

'cause when you speak it's those two who speak through you
who'll speak for me
the burning and the electricity
