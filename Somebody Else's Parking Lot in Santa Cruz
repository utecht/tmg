outside the opera house in sydney,
i saw my life come crashing to its end.
i cried out to the scale-tipper
on whom all living things depend.
strings of giuseppe verdi suffused the evening air.
i wished, i wished, i wished that god would kill me,
instead of leaving me alone to see you standing there
before me. that sad look on your face.
you took me to so many places i never thought i'd go.
this is the worst place.

yeah we did our manners proud
on the night we said goodbye.
no big scene out there on the sidewalk,
as we pinpointed the place where all good things go to die.
i know you hate it when i get my headaches.
well, i've got a real prize tonight.
listening to katia ricciarelli,
it's not going to be alright.
and i'd like to think that this will pass, this will pass.
i know it's not the case.
of all the highs and lows and middle-ends you brought me to,
this is the worst place.
