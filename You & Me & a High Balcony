2 3 4

Clean slate, warm weather
They should tie our ankles both together
Seagulls calling to one another
If a stranger should ask you 
You can tell him I'm your brother

Lean into me, press real hard
I got no good reasons left not to let down my guard
I love your kiss but it's going to come down to this

You and me and a high balcony
and professional wrestling on pay per view
Windows and light and the radio blaring all night
And the truth slowly dawning on me and then on you

Let's pretend we're all alone
Let's unplug the telephone
Our scale doesn't slide
Here comes tonight
Hey, open wide

Don't blink, don't try too hard not to
Just rehearse the alibis your father taught you
See the plastic coatings on the window blister
Anybody asks you, tell 'em you're my sister

Yeah, you and me and a table set for three
Just in case our assassin should finally come through
Anhydrous and matches, why don't we cook up two more batches
With the tide closing in on me and then on you
