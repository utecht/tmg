Wake up sixty minutes after my head hits the pillow I can't live like this
And in the shower I am a sailor standing waiting ready for the ship to list

Everything looks burned up I'm too scared to look around
don't feel like going on but come on make a joyful sound
If you will believe in you heart and confess with your lips
surely you will be saved one day

try to think of ways to fix myself but everything ends in a cul-de-sac
the beast broke from the barn while we were sleeping face it face it he's not coming back

don't see what the point is in even trying to fight
look for the bigger picture when i close my eyes real tight
If you will believe in you heart and confess with your lips
surely you will be saved one day

Look for the sign of Daniel, consider the clues
Wait as long as i have to for good news

Wake and rise and face the day and try to stop the day from staring back at me
Busy hours for joyful hearts and later maybe head out to the pharmacy

Won't take the medication but it's good to have around
A kind and loving God won't let my small ship run aground
If you will believe in you heart and confess with your lips
surely you will be saved one day
