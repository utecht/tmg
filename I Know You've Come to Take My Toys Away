sun flashing red and then orange then opting for secession
on the day when you came to the door with you terrible confession
i know you've come to take my toys away and 
i know you've come to take my toys away

skin flushing red and then glowing when you come inside
and the moonlight watching all over you i have got my mouth open wide
i know you've come to take my toys away and
i know you've come to take my toys away

and when it drops, you're gonna feel it. 
oh yeah
oh yeah
