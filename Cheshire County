when the sun came up, i got up
'cause you were saying my name backwards in your sleep again

the field outside was wet and green, 
and the most goergeous cow i've ever seen
was coming right at me, right at you

her udder was fat with fresh milk
and her black and white coat was as smooth as silk
and in the waning of a long long year
i felt the remnants of last night disappear
(disappear) x7
