i went down yale today
just in the old way
a black dog hobbled past me
his tags jangled on his collar
it made me wish i was dead
it made me wish i was dead

had a familiar sun on me
just like it would always be
rocky soil dry land
i knew it all like the back of my hand
it made me wish i was dead
it made me wish i was dead

a terrific view form here
the sky's clear
the sun's high
i let things lie 
and i know what is and isn't mine
and i was good to get back to the sunshine
but 5 years is a long time
and i spent 5 years in sweden dying for you
i spent 5 years in sweden dying for you
