Let the stars come out, and the moon shine bright
weâ€™re sleeping on the porch tonight
wind blew all the power lines down
watch where you step if you go walking around

this may be the night
our bodies fill with light
and we may hover above
the surface of
our warm, lonely planet

Let cooling rains come, let them fall
let the grass grow strong and tall
let the dandelions breed
give me what you know I need

this may be the night
our bodies fill with light
and we may hover above
the surface of
our warm, lonely planet
