don't write a letter 
when you want to leave 
don't call me at three a.m. from your friend's apartment 

I'd like to choose 
how I hear the news 
take me to a park that's covered with trees 
tell me on a sunday please 

let me down easy no big song and dance 
no long faces no long looks just deep conversation 
I know the way 
I want to spend that day 

take me to the zoo 
with big chimpanzees 
tell me on a sunday please 

don't want to know who's to blame 
won't help knowing 
I don't want to fight day and night 
it's bad enough that you're going 
don't leave in silence - no words at all 
don't get mad and slam the door 
it's no way to end this 

I know how I 
want you to say goodbye 
by the circus tent with a big trapeeze 
tell me on a sunday please 

I don't want to fight day and night 
it's bad enough that you're going 
don't leave in silence - no words at all 
don't get mad and slam the door 
it's no way to end this 

I know how I 
want you to say goodbye 

don't run off in the pouring rain 
don't call me as they call your plane 
take the hurt out of all the pain 

take me to a park that's covered with trees 
tell me on a sunday please
