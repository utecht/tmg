Shuffled up Sixth Street in the rain
Kept my head down as I pushed past the people
And in the department store
I found what I was looking for
This is the church, this is the crucible

They come out to Broadway and they look for me
I'm on the red steps smoking a cigarette
Easy to recognize
Black bandages on my eyes
This is the church, these are the congregants

Sunset's on the Broad Square and lights come up
Feel like this town's gonna put a quick end to me
But if I came here to drown
I'm gonna take a few people down
This is the church occupied by the enemy
