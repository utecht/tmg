I will wake up at six a.m. again
And I will find my way to the front door like a soldier crawling through the smoke and carnage
Smoldering bodies at my feet
I'd love to stick around but I've got someone to meet
And I will put my best foot forward
And I'll thank God I made it out of there
On the day when my new friends come

I will present myself in my nice white tuxedo jacket
And I will look out at the day through my dark sunglasses 
And take in the scenes
The house behind me and the people in it will all go up like steam in just a minute
There's gonna be a redefining of the borders
And I will recieve my orders
On the day when my new friends come

The rooftops and the sidewalks 
Will all melt like plastic
And old friends, old friends, dear friends
I'm gonna look fantastic
There wont be any reason left to cry
Because there wont be any people left to cry for
My memory's gonna vaporize itself
And my Italian shoes, well, they will be to die for
I believe I can fly
While you look up at me and wave goodbye
On the day when my new friends come
