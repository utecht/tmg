If you really want to conjure up a ghost
Cultivate a space for the things that hurt you most

Rake the sands until they surface
Bind their tiny eyes

Stake out your position, let your armor fall
Stay put til they find you, it won't take long at all

Rake the sands until they surface
Up they come, gone translucent

They're coming up no matter what
Fools rush in and the doors slam shut

Ghosts of my childhood stay with me, if you will
Find a place where there's water, hold you under til you're still

Rake the sands until they surface
Don't let anybody call them ugly
