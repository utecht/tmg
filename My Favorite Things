Champagne bubbled up through the neck of the bottle,
And sweet sounds came out through the radio.
It was John Coltrane.
God damn it, I love John Coltrane!

You danced across the living room floor, 
And you kissed me once and then you kissed me some more.
You had your arms wrapped around my neck and it felt real fine,
And then your ankle knocked up against mine.
And resonating in my bones
Was the precise crisp drumming of Mr. Elvin Jones.
God damn it, I love John Coltrane!
