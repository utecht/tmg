Out behind the safeway, 
Just before the flood
Huffed some cans of spray paint
And began to vomit blood.
One more night in this town
Is gonna break me I just know.
Hang on to your dreams 'til someone makes you let them go.

Stumbled on down Indian Hill,
Tail between my legs.
Sick taste in my mouth
Folger's crystals and hard boiled eggs.
If I can't run away tonight,
I don't know what I'll do
Hang on to your dreams 'til someone beats them out of you.

Do what you have to do.
Go where you have to go.
When the time comes to loosen up your grip, you'll know.

Called my friend in New York
Three thousand miles away
Half way through her metamorphosis, nothing I could say.
Hoard my small resentments 
Like rare and priceless gems
Hang on to your dreams until there's nothing left of them.
