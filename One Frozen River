when my old friend came crawling up the hill,
broken and bloody,
carrying her hair in clumps in her hands,
i let her right on in,
let her right in.

when she stood at the kitchen window,
staring out at the countryside,
and then she looked my way.
i let her right on in,
let her right in.

and when she was stronger than she'd been before,
i opened the front door.
and then i opened the back door.
and the sunlight poured in. 
yeah.
