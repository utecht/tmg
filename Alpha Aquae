i've grown rather tired of our little game.
you ask me the question.
my answer's the same.
and i couldn't say the day or the year.
but it must be summer, 'cause there's flies in here.
i need water.
i need water.

ants on the window ledge caught my attention.
and i wanted to say so, but i was to tired to mention it.
and we crawled in bed, and melted together.
cursing each other.
cursing the weather.
and i need water.
i need water.
