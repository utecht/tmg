the moon's full, and the sky is bright, 
and so you and me are gonna get drunk tonight. 
we're gonna steal some tractors and head on into town, 
find the main strip and start mowing them down. 

don't come to the window till you're sure it's me. 
don't ignore the obvious. take a deep breath. 
put your hand on the god damn radio. 
put your hand on the god damn radio. 

fields are full of spirits, but no one cares at all. 
a light above you flickers when you hear me call. 
and I'm shaking when I see you there cause I don't know what it means. 
but the ground is looking dry tonight and bursting near the seams. 

so don't come to the window till you're sure it's me. 
don't ignore the obvious. take a deep breath. 
put your hand on the god damn radio. 
put your hand on the god damn radio, yeah.
