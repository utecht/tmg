if you get there before me, will you save me a seat?
if you get there before me, would you save me a seat?
but if i never get there at all,
would you leave the seat empty?

if you get there before me, will you light us a fire?
if you get there before me, will you light us a fire?
but if i never show,
will you watch the embers glow?
would you keep the fire burning?

this is a song for you, in case i never make it through to where you are.
