Just when the last of the smoke subsides you'll see my fingers
Hoisting my body up atop the charred debris
Who is that creature with the crazed look in his eyes?
Don't even question your senses
You can be sure that's me
When all the pretenders to your hand lie dead across the land,
I'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
Crawling around, down on the ground

When the Hail Marys you've been saying lose their savor
Just when your dungeon walls feel like they're closing in
Whose are those bloody knuckles reaching down to grab you
Just as the last of the light overhead is growing dim?
It was their love you wanted, not mine
But when they deny your name three times
I'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
Crawling around, down on the ground

And I will throw you across my shoulders
And I will bleed and I will drool
And the cameras will slow pan across my face
And I will try to say something cool

Just as the hoardes of thirsting demons close around us
Raising their axes, howling like monkeys in the sun
Who will that guy be holding you so high above them?
You know and I know, everyone knows it, I'm the one
I may have failed you once before
But this right here, this means war
I'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
Crawling around, down on the ground
