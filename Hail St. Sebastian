it gets hard to keep trying to hold on
watch our hopes take wing
wave at them when they're gone
plunge like suicides from rooftops 
break our ankles when we land
and bless the arrows that strike us where we stand

if it doesn't crush me
its alright
if it doesn't break me
its alright
all the petty demons trying to break me in two
i was born stronger than any of you
its alright
its alright
its alright

it gets complicated when they come in for their counter attack
everybody hates a victim
who won't stop fighting back
spray blood in their faces
play for keeps
and bless the brave assassins who strike us while we sleep
