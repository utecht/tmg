everything i've told you was true
so imagine my surprise when i blink my eyes 
and realize that i've been talking to you
and i've told you everything
even the parts i'd meant to leave out
and i shake my hair, and i look about

and the wild dogs are hungry
and the wild dogs howl
and the wild dogs in the mountains to the north of us
come down
