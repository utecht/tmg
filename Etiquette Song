rain washing your memory away.
fires burning somewhere around here.
clouds forming, clouds gathering.
one minute in a long, long year.
you've got one good reason for doing what you're going to do.
i've got one thing holding me back from doing the same thing to you.

in the san gabriels the fire ate away
rabbit rush and the jimson weed.
when the rain came it was like an old friend.
when you came by you had just what i needed.

you've got one hour left before something happens alright?
and the then rain will come down tonight.
