the street's alive
we're not alone
our legs move like well-oiled gears
and i know we're never going home
there is a dwarf on the corner
with a cup in his hand
a black hat on his big head
he sings a little song and then the sky turns red

and just now
when i catch sight of you
in the burning sun
you strike me as mean-spirited

let the dwarf come out
let the old songs come
the scales tip back
and the arpeggiates can run
once i knew what to say to you
now the words will not come through
and i love you underneath a red sky
but for the life of me i couldn't say why

and just now
when i catch sight of you
in the burning sun
you strike me as mean-spirited
