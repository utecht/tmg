When it came time to wait for you
I took the bus to Malibu
Found a cafe by the ocean
Watched the sky for signs
And a rainbow in the west
Wrapped its coils around the earth
Like a serpent
I felt like I was going to suffocate

And I knew this was not the day
You would finally come my way
But I waited all the same
Watched the water through the window
And a rainbow in the west
Held its head beneath the waves
And grew dimmer
Nothing anyone could do, I suppose
