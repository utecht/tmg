the moon shining, 
three hours into the best part of the day and
i want to tell you that you're so pretty and 
the words come out wrong and the range gets in the way..
dead quiet you looked at me like you were looking into space.
yeah, in space noone could hear you say good bye.
but down here i shouldn't have to read it on your face.
that's not normal.
that's not right.
that's not very nice.
no, it isn't.

the moon shining down on your body.
you look so nice.
and i want to tell you, but you don't want to hear it,
and i know. you don't have to tell me twice.
but, once would be civil. the moon shining.
i got it in my brain, and i had so much to say but there was dead quiet.
you were silent. three hours -- into the best part of the day.
and that's not normal.
that's not right.
that's not very nice.
no, it isn't.

and that's not normal.
that's not right.
that's not very nice.
no, it isn't.
