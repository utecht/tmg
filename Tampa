my brother and me found out where you keep your ugly secrets hid.
we dug up the missing one this morning.
i know what you did what you did.
yeah, we found him naked in the snow.
down where the wild krokus grow.
and i don't wanna do this anymore.
i ain't wanna fight your dirty little war.

my brother said not to waste another thin dime because
he ain't comin' out next time, and you can
soak in a bathtub full of gasoline, but you will
never get your hands clean.
yeah the building was raging fire was glowing within
you ran out to save your own skin, and
well, i probably shouldn't blame you.
yeah, i probably shouldn't blame you.
but by god, i do,
and i found the photographs in the top dresser drawer
but i ain't gonna fight your dirty little war
anymore.
