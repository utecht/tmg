Tunnel down to the core 
Climb through the trap door
Soft pink sky full of rumpled clouds
Radio up loud

There's a pop in the speaker
Where I hear your voice come through
So brave and true
When did I lose sight of you?

Come and rattle your chain
All you want
You're always gonna be welcome
Here in the hallways that you used to haunt

Ride the sentimental rodeo
Down to where the shadows grow
Long while since I felt this way
Stand by the window wait for day

There's a pop in the speaker
Where I hear your voice come through
So brave and true
Let me never lose sight of you

Come and rattle your chain
All you want
You're always gonna be welcome
Here in the hallways that you used to haunt
