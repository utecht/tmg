i was standing outside with my hands in the air.
and the scent of gardenias was everywhere.
let the house come down on me.
let the house come down on me.

i made my invocation with my eyes on fire.
you were there at the window.
you are a god damned liar.
let the house come down on me.
let the house come down on you.
