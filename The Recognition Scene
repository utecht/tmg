You broke the doorknob off the door
The door swung open easily
You sauntered into the poorly lit store
And looked around lazily
We stole every bit of candy they had inside
Gobbled it all up greedily on our three-month ride
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone

We headed out to the getaway car
Hit the open road
Saw something written in tall clear letters on your face
But I could not break the code
We had hot caramel sticking to our teeth
The only love I've ever known burning underneath
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
