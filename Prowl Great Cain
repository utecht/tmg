Gather jewels from graveyards, when I get home bury them again
Wonder if you'll ever get the chance to ask me why I turned you in
I saved my own skin but I live to fight, I live to fight another day
Still remember how brave you were when they came to take you away

And I feel guilty but I can't feel ashamed
Prowl through empty fields, great Cain

Thought I'd seen the ghost up on the boulevard, between the broken bits
It's hard to tell gifts of the spirit from clever counterfeits. 
Sleepwalk through my days and mark the hours until these dark times fade
Like a caterpillar crawling out along the surface of the blade

And I feel guilty but I can't feel ashamed
Prowl through empty fields, great Cain

Rummage through the gutted storehouse now
And lick the sweat from my brow
Saw the trucks roll out this morning, not sure when they're coming back again
Feel the prickings of my conscience in my chest ever now and then

Sometimes a great wave of forgetfulness rises up and blesses me
And other times the sickness howls and I despair of any remedy

And I feel guilty but I can't feel ashamed
Prowl through empty fields, great Cain
