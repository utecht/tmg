Streak the windows
Smear the walls with cocnut oil, yeah
Fill a cast-iron kettle with water and a magnolia blosson
Let it boil
Let the water roll
Let the fire take its toll, I'm coming home
I'm coming home

Dust off the idols, give them something to eat
I think they're hungry
I know I'm starving half to death
I know you're waiting
I know you've been waiting for a long, long time, and I'm
Coming home
I'm coming home

Set the table, those three extra places
One for me
One for your doubts
And one for God

Let the insence burn
In every room
Feel the fullness of time
In the empty tomb
Feel the future
Kicking in your womb - I'm
Coming home
I'm coming home.
