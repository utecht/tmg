I hear you moving in the hallway. 
I hear you sharpening your claws. 
I hear you polishing your teeth, sometimes. 
but I don't mind. 

and I hear you out in the garage. 
I hear you messing with the motor. 
I hear you tinker with the engine, sometimes. 
but I don't mind. 

and I hear you moving in the kitchen! 
I hear you in there late at night. 
I notice when you leave the gas jets on sometimes. 
but I don't mind.
