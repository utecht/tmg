The sun above me and the concrete floor below
Scratch at the chain links, maybe bare my teeth for show
Fed twice a day, I don't grow hungry anymore
Feel in my bones just what the future has in store
I pace in circles so the camera will see
Look hard at my stripes, there will be no more after me

Laze by the shoreline while the sailors disembark
Scratch out a place to sit and rest down in the dark
Smell something burning downwind, just a little way
They set up camp and said I'd sweat and work for days
I have no fear of anyone; I'm dumb and wild and free
I am a flightless bird, and there will be no more after me

In Costa Rica, in a burrow underground
Climb to the surface, lick my eyes and look around
I'm all alone as I try my time in song
Claim my place beneath the sky but I won't be here for long
I sang all night, the moon shone only through the trees
No brothers left, and there will be no more after me
