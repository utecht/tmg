the moon was unbearably high. 
flowering plant that hung from the radiator pipe. 
it was dripping sweat from its rapidly fading petals. 
and to the humming world in which I was living, 

a crescendoing stepping sound came in. 
heard you stepping over three weeks' worth of newspapers 
piled up outside the door. 

I hear you knocking. 
come in. 
turn on the radio. 
turn up the volume. 

you sat down in the same place where you used to sit. 
it brought back a memory or two. 
I may not know much any more, but I remember you. 

you were quiet for a while, and that was nice. 
then you came along with your questions, 
always questions. 
I don't have any answers to those particular questions. 

I hear you talking. 
shut up! 
turn on the radio. 
turn up the volume.
