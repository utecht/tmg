picked up a fat, gold watch for you
down where the river washes over the avenue.
and i listened to it tick away the minutes.
looked out at the awful sky.

i was afraid that my arm was broken, 
but it was only kinda run down.
i went walking after two last night,
felt like i was the only guy in town.
and i'm not.
i know.
and i don't need you to tell me so.
look at this watch.
look at this watch.
you won't believe what this thing can do.
