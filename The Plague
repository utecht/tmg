There will be blue skies /
Above the green and fordid plain /
Churns will swell with fresh butter /
There will be an abundance of sweet grain /
And we will rise from our sleep /
We won't have time to choose what things we'll keep /
And rivers will all turn to blood /
Frogs will fall from the sky /
And the plague will rage /
Through the countryside /
Lalalala /
Lalalala /
La la la /
La la la /
La la la /
There will be cotton clouds /
Above the fields as white as cream /
There will be loud singing /
In the churches /
As we all come out to take one for the team /
And all our great schemes and plans /
Will slip like fishes from our hands /
And rivers will all turn to blood /
Frogs will fall from the sky /
And the plague will cover /
The country with its anger /
Lalalala /
Lalalala /
La la la /
La la la /
La la la  /
Hey.
