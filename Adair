i got my eye on the scar
it runs clear from your temple to your jawline
you'll tell me about all your thoughts right this minute
then I will tell you mine.

'cause i got the wind in my hair
and I'm far away from where i used to be
but i got all my attention fixed on you
and you're flashing that smile at me.

with the midwestern sky burning above us
we lean up against the car
i want to tell you what the sky has done to me
i want you to tell me who we are
'cause i see you raising the water to your lips
it's the blazing dead center of july
and i got all my hopes hung on one gorgeous promise
and you got the sunlight dancing on your eyes

and i got the wind in my hair
and i'm far away from where i used to be
but i got all my attention fixed on you
and you're just where you said you'd be
just where you said you'd be
