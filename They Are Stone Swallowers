You went away to Stockholm for a week
You came back with some scratch-marks on your cheeks
The towers line the highway and they cry
From deep down in their guts until they die

The water tower crew are total devils
Toxicity near saturation levels
I rise up and greet the day
See the serpents rising from the clay

You were headed down to Salzburg for the night
All my hair was turning white
You and your crew were good to go
So many people that weï¿½ll never really know

I saw the city men they make me laugh
Digging up the cables, cutting them in half
I watch the ancient sun until it balls
See the serpents coming through the walls
