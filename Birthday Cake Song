the sun came out this morning i was wide awake
and i made way down to the kitchen and i cut myself
a piece of my birthdaty caeke
raspberry filling in the middle
and i thought about you a little
and there was a time when you wanted me so bad
it was eating you up inside
this time has gone away

i pour myself a tall glass of milk
it was deep and cold
and i checked my driver's license i was 28 years old 
and there was a time when you wanted me so bad
it was eating you up inside
this time has gone away
