i see you've come to call you want to tear the palm tree down.
but i mean to tell you me and the palm tree we don't need you around.
we don't need you.
we don't need anyone else.
'cause we can rip our roots up from the cool soft ground
all by ourselves.

and you come toward the two of us with your arms extended lovingly,
but i've got a hammer.

sweat breaks on my temples as i see you come toward me.
and i shouold've known that this was exactly how it was gonna be.

what have i done to deserve this?
what did i ever do?
what have i done to deserve this?
what did i do to you?

and you come toward the two of us with your arms extended lovingly,
but i've got a hammer.
