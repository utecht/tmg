i saw the darkness coming down, 
it posed no threat to me
i let the dakrness ease its way around
it was every good thing 
i'd expected it would be
i saw you coming, 
through the twisting vines outside
i saw the new moon collide 
with the stars 
clustered around her.

i saw the young fruit, on the new lime
i felt your breath catch it's rhythm.
i heard your legs push away the tall dry brush
i saw the moon and the stars 
and knew the secrets within them.
i heard you saying 
my name into my ear
no one has to tell me 
why you've come here,
'cause i know.
i know.
i know.
