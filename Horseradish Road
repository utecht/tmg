the way that everybody's voice, comes out muffled when they speak,
the way we take our diminishing inventories, 
month to month and
week to week,
the maria callas records on the stereo all the time
you're gonna get yours and i'm gonna get mine.
'cause in this car, in this car,
somebody's bound to get burned.
i know.
i know.
because i've been watching the road turn.

the enigma variations on the radio
the things that i could guess at,
the things that i already know.
and the twelve thousand dollars that turned up in your purse,
you've done something awful.
i've done something worse.
and in this car, in this car,
somebody's bound to get burned.
i know.
i know.
because i've been watching the road turn.
