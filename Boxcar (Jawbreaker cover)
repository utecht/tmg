You're not punk, and I'm telling everyone
Save your breath, I never was one
You don't know what I'm all about
Like killing cops and reading Kerouac
My enemies are all too familiar
They're the ones who used to call me friend
I'm coloring outside your guidelines
I was passing out when you were passing our your rules
One, two, three, four
Who's punk, what's the score?
Got a friend
Her name is Boxcar
Cigarettes and beer in El Sob
Her hair was blue, now it's green
I like her mind, she hates the scene
You're on your own
You're all alone
