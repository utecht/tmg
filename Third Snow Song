in january i took a short walk
down to the broadway bridge
two and a half blocks
when you scrape the ice away
you can read the bridge dedication
i can feel the cold air coming in through my teeth
i saw the bridge
i saw the water underneath
that's a whole lotta water
that's a whole lotta water

i took out the key that i'd forgotten the function of
twisted it from the keyring as the bridge loomed above
i hammered it against the ice
i hammered it against the ice
