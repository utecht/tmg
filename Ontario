I know what my weaknesses are
probably better than you do
revolutionary Chinese propaganda
the color of blue
I thought I knew what my weaknesses were
anyway
and then the orange tree blossomed 
last Saturday
there was nothing in it but pain for me

I know what can hurt me real bad
and what can't hurt me anymore
I am learning to rise up with the sun 
and I am learning what sleep good is for
I thought I figured out the world
and it's circular way
but then I saw the sun fall down
out of the sky the other day
there was nothing in it but pain for me

squirrel climbing trees in bloom
soft yellow light spilling into the room
my favorite records
my favorite books
the people I love
the people I almost love
light beckoning
wind whistling
hey hey
hey hey
daybreaking
river rolling
hey hey
la la la la
