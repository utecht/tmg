when i walked past the chain link fence
and the guard dog came forward to attack me
i knew you were coming home 
i knew you were on your way back
well in baltimore, you will find what you've been waiting for
in baltimore, you will find what you've been waiting for

just beyond the last of the sidewalk, where the beach begins
i heard the airplanes announcing the apocolypse
saw the 737's coming on in
will you hold on for just a minute
will you hold on while i catch my breath
listen, in baltimore, you'll uncover what you've been digging for
in baltimore, you will find what you've been waiting for
