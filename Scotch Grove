on the way home from the party,
neither one of us said a word.
leann rimes on the car stereo
sang that song you know I hate.
the one about the blackbird
and the rain came down on the windshield-
i wished it would wash us both away.
you had to open up your mouth, didn't you?
i knew what you were gonna say.
and you were Bluebeard, Bluebeard's wife
opening every cupboard, trying to find the smoking gun.
well i told you i told you,
i told you not to open that one.
