i saw the long row of blue bells.
i saw the fox glove and the night shade.
i saw the cool garden and i though a while about
how i'd been waiting for you since the second grade.
the flowers made the air boil.
the boiling air made me think of you a while.
i did not come here to suffer.
i did not come here to suffer.

i heard the ducks all quacking.
i saw the sunshine on the lake.
i saw you standing near the water
and wondered how long i'd be paying for one dumb mistake.
the sight of you was really something else.
but i don't know what that something else was.
i did not come here to suffer.
i did not come here to suffer.
