We were drinking Colorado Bulldogs
When inspiration struck
And we knew it was high time
For us to change our own luck
We cracked a couple Coca Colas open
Mixed em up with vodka and some coffee liqueur
Poured in some cold milk 
Raised glasses high to old friends
My love for you is 98 percent pure 
But the two percent that remains
Has fried the circuits in my brain

I got out my smoking jacket
You put on some fishnets 
And your smart black beret
We cut quite a figure in the mirror
And then we were on our way

Oh would that you would kiss me
With the kisses of your mouth
Because your mouth is sweeter 
Than wine and has
A more complicated history 
Than the American South
As the evening took us in
You could have popped the tension
With a safety pin

We went down to Pete Brown's Chevrolet
Because Pete Brown can satisfy
All your new car needs
We were nicely oiled by then
Our internal transponders 
Picking up satellite feeds
From well worn ancient places
Our eager young sales rep handed us the keys
We drove about three-quarters of a mile
All that's left for us now
Is moments like these
We parked behind the  high school
Away from the light
And the flames climbed high into the night
