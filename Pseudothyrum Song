why do you treat me this way?
and why do you try so hard to break my spirit?
i think someone was mean to you when you were little,
that's what i think.
i think someone was mean to you.

why do you cling to such petty points of contention?
and why don't you allow one or two small victories now and then?
i think someone was mean to you when you didn't deserve it,
that's what i think.
i think someone was mean to you.

but i, i am not that guy.
can you get that straight?
i am a completely different person
from the one you have in mind.

why do you stand by the things you say long after
you don't mean to hurt anybody anymore?
i think someone was mean to you
for a long, long time, that's what i think.
i think someone was mean to you.
