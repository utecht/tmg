you slimy, rich, white bastards
you slimy, rich, white bastards

well your parents sent you out from the east coast
because they were very, very tired of having you proselytize around the house
when you were only sixteen years old
they were willing to spend twenty-one thousand dollars 
a year plus whatever other money you needed for gas
and expensive snacks
and meals out
and weekends in TJ
you slimy, rich, white bastards
you slimy, rich, white bastards
you slimy, rich, white bastards
