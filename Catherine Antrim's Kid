brush all the dust of Kansas
off of my special shoes
when the coach lets us out at the corner store
mom was coughing like an old man, shivering like a cold man

and i found some trouble to get into
and the admiration was mutual
split my winnings with mom 55/45 
but it didn't keep her alive

I got lost out there in new mexico
nothing to lose nowhere to go
I got lost when my lucky stars crossed

that night I dreamt about Ft. Stanton
though I didn't know to call it that yet
and the night wrapped me up in its long dark embrace
I had that same expression on as that one picture of my face

which was all anyone would ever know about me
after my visitors got done with me
I lay down singing on the porch blood streaming from my mouth
sounded kind of like Paul Westerberg but to tell you the truth 

I got lost out there in new mexico
nothing to lose nowhere to go
I got lost when my lucky stars crossed
