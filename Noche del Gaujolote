The glowing world
The bench backed up against the house
The chicken coops
The darkness surrounding everything
It was late 
and the night was moving slowly
And we lay down on the ground
Because the world was lonely

If you keep quiet it'll stay like this forever
If you'll just keep quiet it'll stay like this forever
I feel certain of it now

And all the birds were sleeping in their perches
A little wind swaying perches
And the North American wild turkey
That your father brought home
Woke up and came toward us
And the moonlight
And the turkey waking up
And the night air
And the moonlight on your skin
And the moonlight 
And the turkey waking up
And the quiet yard
And the turkey and the moon
Unimaginable, unimaginable, unimaginable, unimaginable
