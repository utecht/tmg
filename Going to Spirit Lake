why did you say what you said when the hummingbird vanished from sight?
a sudden, swelling heat in the dark october night.
you laughed and your eyes were alive,
and i knew that the moment had finally arrived.
and i reached out and held for your hand and held on tight.
you said the right thing.
you fixed everything
as the stars formed a canopy over spirit lake.
you said what you said.
the stars grew softer overhead.
i was on fire.
i was on fire for you.
