you look so cool in your summer dress.
you look so cool in your summer dress.
you walk across the high school campus
in the bright sunshine,
you can't imagine my surprise when your gaze meets mine.
and i may be young, but i know
what you're thinking.
                                                                                
you look so cool as you glide into the teacher's lounge.
you look so cool as you glide into the teacher's lounge.
and i may be only seventeen,
but i know what that look means.
and if you think i'm all talk and no action,
try me.
                                                                                
i touch your thin hand as we roll back into town.
in your car i touch your thin hand later on as we roll back into town.
after words you drop me off one block away
and i'm young and strong and healthy,
it's a bright spring day.
and it may be that it's just me, but in the sunlight
you look different.
