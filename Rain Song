The rain came down,
Soaked the old Hibachi.
And I wish I could sing,
Like Allen Calachi. (?)

Then you would know,
How sad it was, 
When the rain came down.

Drop by drop, gallon by gallon.
Brother If I could sing, if I could sing like Allen.

Then you would know, 
And understand,
How sad it was, 
When the rain came down.
