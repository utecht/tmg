The house was pretty and the yard was wide
And I felt strong with you at my side
Your eyes at night had a beautiful glowing in them
And I knew in my heart just what was growing in them

Ah, but you made me drink poison
It felt smooth running down my throat
I love you, and you made me drink poison
It was cool and smooth and sweet
Do you remember?

We had a bed of daisies thriving in the yard
And I quit my job, so I could hold you all the time
I tried to stop the thing metastasizing in us
But in the warm, slow evening
I could feel it rising in us

Ah, and you made me drink poison
It felt so smooth, sliding down my throat
I love you so much, and you made me drink poison
It was cool and smooth and sweet and cool
And smooth and sweet and cool and smooth
