i was sitting in the street when the news came my way (2x)
good news (4x)
i was sitting in the street when the messenger came by 
i was sitting in the street when the messenger came my way
good news, good news like a rare blood disorder
good news (2x)

i was sitting in the street
i don't believe i've made it clear what exactly i mean by that
i was sitting in the middle of the street
dust made its way into my legs even though my shirt was tucked in
and i saw the colors forming in the west
saw the bright feathers reflected in the sky, now
good news (4x)
