Taste ?...? in the air
You can feel them in your throat
?Follow? you now with a warm overcoat
Rain'l be here ?...?
I won't be here to see it now

You take high road and I'll take the low
I'l be in Scotland before you]
Me and my true love never meet again
By the bonnie bonnie banks of loch lomond

You've been the best company I've ever hoped to find
you were my nurse, you've eased my mind
But Heading off into the setting sun
there's two of us now, there's only gonna be one

You take high road and I'll take the low
I'l be in Scotland before you]
Me and my true love never meet again
By the bonnie bonnie banks of loch lomond

Put quarters on my eyes
Demand that i apologise
But I need a cup of coffee, shake  my hand
Wish me good luck man

You take high road and I'll take the low
I'l be in Scotland before you]
Me and my true love never meet again
By the bonnie bonnie banks of loch lomond
