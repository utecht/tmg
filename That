i will praise your eyes
for burning my house down
i am humbled by how they made the framework fall to the ground
i stood with you and watched you
as you made it burn and fall
in minutes it was almost like it had never been there at all
when the traffic on the street thins out for just a second
i will look into your eyes
i, i will not panic
i am standing on the corner
where you and i were standing
i am trying to look at the sky
there are too many colors surrounding me

i will praise your eyes
they have reduced this city to embers
i will see you coming
i will see your eyes through the cold air from a mile away
