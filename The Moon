i thought that i was in control.
when i saw her coming, i reached out my hand.
you, you, you would think so too
but there is something here that you do not understand.
she's got skin like you would not believe.
i saw her skin and i went out of my mind.
she's got skin more perfect that the sky,
and i reached out my hand and left the world behind.

noone knew what i was talking about,
i used to say that what i saw through my window
was brilliant sap and strong white camelias.
now i see you coming, and i just don't think so.
she's got skin like you would not believe.
i saw her skin and i went out of my mind.
i reached out my hand and i walked out into the rain.
i was right behind the clouds.
i could just see ya coming.
yeah.
