Maybe, maybe it's the clothes we wear
Our tasteless bracelets and the dye in our hair
Maybe it's our kookiness…

Or maybe, maybe it's our nowhere towns
Our nothing places and our cellophane sounds
Maybe it's our looseness…

But we're trash, you and me
We're the litter on the breeze
We're the people on the streets.

We’re trash, me and you
It's in everything we do.
It's in everything we do…

Maybe, maybe it's the things we say
The places we go and the music we play
Maybe it's our cheapness…

Or maybe, maybe it's the times we've had
The lazy days and the crazes and the fads
Maybe it's our sweetness…

But we're trash, you and me
We're the litter on the breeze
We're the people on the streets.

We’re trash, me and you
It's in everything we do.
It's in everything we do…

Just trash, you and me
We're the people on the streets
We're the litter on the breeze…

We’re trash, me and you
It's in everything we do.
It's in everything we do…
