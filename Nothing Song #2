when the milkman used to leave two fresh quarts of milk every other morning just before we woke up
when we saw the guy who used to stock in his paper machines stop his truck and have a cigarette at 5am
where the birds gathered on the high tension wire
where we lit the dry leaves on fire
for nothing
nothing
nothing

where the imprint of your head used to be pressing in the pillow next to me
when the mailman came in to ask for water
when we turned him away for no good reason
where things were set up
where things were knocked over
for nothing
nothing
nothing
nothing
nothing
nothing
