Lose a little feeling in my fingers,
gain an edge of panic in my face.
Search for some sign to tell me just how long I've been here;
Overturn the place

Feels like each time my efforts fail,
the whole hillsides disapprove.
Feel like a man whose veins have frozen overnight;
lying there trying to move...

Yeah, when the crack sounds in the wood,
you will know that I'm down for good.
When the crack sounds in the wood
you will know, old friend, that I'm down for good.

I want to try to stand my ground;
dig my heels into the hills.
Hope someone will come to write my ballads.
No one will.

Feels like when I try to stretch my legs,
everyone around me's trying too.
So ready just to fall down, just to fall down,
and to stay down;
I don't want to spoil the view.

Yeah, when the crack sounds in the wood,
you will know that I'm down for good.
When the crack sounds in the wood,
you will know, old friend, that I'm down for good.
