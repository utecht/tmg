i hear you starting up again
i see you standing on the deck
i hear your voice start to carry
i see the veins throbbing in you neck

and i know what you're saying
and i know what you're saying it for
but i'm not listening
i'm not listening anymore

and i see you come toward me
i see the sun slimb down the sky
i hear your voice getting faster and louder
i see a stranger in your eyes

and i know what you're saying
and i know what you're saying it for
but i'm not listening
i'm not listening anymore
