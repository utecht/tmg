it's heaven up here, 
but it's heaven down there! 
and you're gonna leave me. 
now I don't care. 

it's heaven outside, 
but it's heaven indoors. 
well, go on and leave me. 
I don't care any more. 

I hear the airplane coming! 
I hear the airplane coming! 
I hear the airplane coming, now, 
it can't touch me. 

I see you going up the little stair. 
go on and board the plane, 
I don't care. I, 

I see you hold his hand. 
I see you wave good-bye. 
I don't know you anymore, 
so I'm not going to cry, now, 

I see the airplane coming! 
I feel the airplane coming! 
I hear the airplane coming, now, 
it can't touch me.
