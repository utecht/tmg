we saw the ship meet the horizon.
we saw it carry him away.
and the streamers on the hull were the last things to wink out of existance
as a cool breeze came in from across the bay.
you dug around in the sand.
you came up holding something.
and when you handed it over with that smile on your face,
i knew the three of us meant less than nothing.
i held the seashell next to my ear, but i didn't hear anything.
i held the seashell next to my ear, but i didn't hear anything.

the dogfish swam beneath the jetty.
where our legs hung down.
and the ocean hugged the sun with her long arms
as the lights came up above chinatown.
i guess this makes it all easier.
i guess it's smooth sailing now.
i guess this irons out all the wrinkles from the fabric.
i guess it never really mattered anyhow.
i held the seashell next to my ear, but i didn't hear anything.
