From this valley they say you are going,
We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile.
For they say you are taking the sunshine,
That had brightened all our pathways for a while.

Come and sit by my side if you love me.
Do not hasten to bid me adieu,
But remember the red river valley,
And the cowboy who loved you so true.
