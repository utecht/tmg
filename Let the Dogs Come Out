new rivers forming on the surface of the world,
i mean to say that it's raining.
otis redding tried to tell me there'd be days like this,
but i didn't believe him.
yeah otis redding talked about this kind of thing.
when i'm only semi-conscious and i hear the phone ring.

let the dogs come out.
i'm ready now.
let the dogs come out.
i'm ready now.

and i remember where i was the last time that it rained like this.
and i remember where i was the last time it was raining this hard.
well, do you remember where i was?
and i know that you remember where we were last time it rained like this.

let the dogs come out.
i'm ready now.
let the dogs come out.
i'm ready now.
