we sat together on the porch,
as the sunset bled.
and you playfully levelled your semi-automatic handgun right at my head.
and then god, in another stroke of his genius,
he opened up the floodgates.
and the bulls came out.
and the bulls came out.

we heard the heavy hooves beating on the earth
as the moment came near.
i felt the chamber of your pistol kissing my jaw.
i felt your red lips brushing my ear.
and then god, convincing if not transparent in his motives,
he opened up the floodgates.
but the rivers were dry, 'cause it was late august.
and the bulls came out.
and the bulls came out.
