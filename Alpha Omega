On the morning you went away
the air was humid and the sky was gray

I had boiled peanuts for breakfast from cairo, georgia

the air was wet, my face was wetter
the pink flowers along the western window made me feel better
I turned the air conditioner on
found the note on scented stationary - you were long gone

I had boiled peanuts for breakfast from cairo, georgia

I popped the top off of the aluminum can
let the brine slide down my fingers, man
it was warm, it was warm on my skin
but i felt the cold blast looming on in

I had boiled peanuts for breakfast from cairo, georgia
