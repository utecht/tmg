rainbows shone on the glass. 
dew drops gathered on the grass. 
and the yellow sun came into view. 
another god-damned message from you 
well despite your best efforts I feel alright 
against my better judgement I feel alright. 
despite your random acts of violence I feel alright 
despite the force of your fury I feel alright. 

you're mean to me. 
why must you be mean to me? 
you shouldn't forget you see 
what you mean to me.
