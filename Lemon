on the last of his life, jimi hendrix woke up
and made his way down the hall
and he adjusted the knobs on the shower till the water came out just the 
way he liked it
it was hot but not too hot
it was hot but not too hot

on the last afternoon of his life, jimi hendrix went to the kitchen
and got himself a glass of water
he put four ice cubes into the glass
there is nothing like cold water
there is nothing
