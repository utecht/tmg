we were real hungry and half dead 
when you broke out half a loaf of sourdough bread. 
and in the tropical air the scent rose like a spirit. 
moments of grace like this being wholly unmerited. ahh. 

we were newly alive and I felt your hand on my arm. 
I was awake to the sensation and immune from all harm. 
you pressed your soft cheek up against my gut. 
pure gold. nothing but gold,
and I'm gonna bake you a nice coconut cream pie. 
'cause I saw the sky coming down to meet you.
