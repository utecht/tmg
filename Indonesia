The summer came in carrying spring in its mouth, 
Held it up for everyone to see
This is the time when all of our plans and schemes melt down into listless 
anarchy, historically anyway that's been the case 
But this year there's a new pink sheen on your face 
Like the color of a secret flower that grows tall and moist and incorruptible 
In Indonesia, Indonesia

The season tunneled forward like a moth through grain 
Its hunger was an all consuming mindless thing
And you slept for 12 to 14 hours in a stretch
I wondered what the weather in the fall was going to bring
And then you said you dreamt of cowboys 
That were zombies in disguise
Well I knew fall was never coming, 
It was written on your eyes
Like the mist hangs there in the air
On the mountainside where rare and nameless flowers grow
In Indonesia, Indonesia.
