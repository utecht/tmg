saw the sycamore underneath the moon
i was waiting for something & you were sleeping in the living room
and it was five-sixteen a.m. - the air was sharp and cool
and i wondered where you buried our dark little jewel
and the heat rising, in the room
i am digging graves. i am digging graves
and the water boiling, on the stove
i am digging graves. i am digging graves

so i held you close to me
i saw the shadows start to gather outside beneath the sycamore tree
and something was changing
this was something here entirely new
bursting into blossom inside of us both with the sun coming up and
me holding onto you
 
and your body breathing on mine
i am digging graves. i am digging graves
and your hands running through my hair
i am digging graves. i am digging graves
