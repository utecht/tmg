what cars there are
go by like snails
and ice crystals shine
on the staircase's handrails

the quiet air
is worth some discussion
as the windows crack
and the cold is crushing.

they've shut down the roads to the coast.
there's white streets as far as the eye can see
and I'd just as soon
make you disappear as look at you
but I draw you close to me.

how do you feel about that?
how do you feel about that?
