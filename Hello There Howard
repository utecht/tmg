the guy on my right is new 
and he says he feels kinda sad and his hands are cold 
and he refuses the dice 
so I pick 'em up myself.
I let 'em roll. 

and the little white spots gleam like stars 
and the guy on my right gets a look at the stickman 
and he begins to sense where it is that we are 
and the table's hot 
but so am I 
and I grab the bones and I let 'em fly. 
so come 2 come 3 come 4 come 5 come 6 come 7 come 9 
it doesn't matter to me now 
'cause I've got all kinds of time.
