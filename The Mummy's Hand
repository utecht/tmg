If you prick us don’t it sting
if you kick us won’t it hurt
I am wrapped in scraps of linen and pieces of people’s old shirts
but way way underneath all these sticky bands
I hold all my dreams right here in my hands

I will rise from the tomb like an infant emerging from the womb

I spent several thousand years down here all alone
no way to stand the lonely old ache in my bones
say the spell three times
crank up the special effects
I’m going to cast off all my bandages and see what happens next

I will rise fully formed like an infant freshly born

I’ve been trapped too long underneath the ground
In the hollow darkness ain’t no grave gonna hold my body down
I will push my hand up through the earth
and I will rise like the cry of an infant at its birth

Ahahahaha
