you say you came to see me, 
because you had nothing else to do, 
but I've got a radio. 
you say you'd thought you'd stop on by 
and let me have a look at you, 
but I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 

you say you brought some photographs, 
but I don't care to see them, 
'cause I've got a radio. 

you say this place must get dull sometimes, 
but that's not the way I see it. 
'cause I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 
I've got me a radio. 
I've got a radio. 

you see these frogs are treacherous, 
but how long has it been since you've seen my feet? 
you see, I've got a radio. 
you warned me about all sorts of things, 
but that's not the sort of warning that I need. 
you see, I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio.
