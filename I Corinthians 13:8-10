we heard the rats in the rafters scurry by
and we wondered about the color of the sky outside
in warsaw in 1939
it was alright just to be alive
it was good that you were mine
and you held your hands up
to form a heart in the air
you held you hands up with your thumbs touching
they formed a heart in the air

through the peice missing in the brick wall
we had an excellent view of the soldiers coming down the wall
and you held your hands up where i could see them 
in the dark and they formed a heart in the air
you held you hands up
and they formed a heart in the air

i heard the old songs radiating from you
i heard the old songs radiating from you
