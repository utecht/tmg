We got in your car and we hit the highway
Eastern sun was rising over the mountains
Yellow and blood red bits 
like a kaleidoscope 

And flaming swords may guard the garden of Eden
But we consulted maps from earlier days 
Dead languages on our tongues
Holding on to our last hope

And the day was bright and fine
And the highway sign said, ï¿½San Bernardino welcomes youï¿½ï¿½

I checked us into our hotel and filled the bathtub 
And you got in the warm warm water 
I pulled pedals from my pocket
I loved you so much just then

And it was hard but you were brave, you are splendid
And we will never be alone in this world 
no matter what they say
Weï¿½re gonna be okay

We were safe inside
and our new son cried, ï¿½San Bernadino welcomes youï¿½
