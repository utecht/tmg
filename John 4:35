there was a gas leak on a surface street somewhere
and we were stuck in traffic
and so i ran my fingers thorough your hair.
and the sun beat down through the windshield.
can you remember the heat?
and the taste of your tongue was thick and pure and impossibly sweet.
and the fields are white unto harvest.
the fields are white unto harvest now.
the fields are white unto harvest.
the fields are white unto harvest now.

the light turned red then green then yellow then red then green again
and i felt that shivering rippling feeling go through my spleen again.
and you leaned toward me.
and your sweat fell on my shoulder.
and i'm swimming back to that moment now before i get any older.
because the fields are white unto harvest.
the fields are white unto harvest now.
the fields are white unto harvest.
the fields are white unto harvest now.
