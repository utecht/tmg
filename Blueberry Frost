When you saw the evening star
Shining in the freezing sky
I saw something dark and silent
Passing by
Full moon
Deep grass
Cold water
When you said your name out loud
Something broke inside me
Nothing new to take ahold of
No new world to hide me
Full moon
Deep grass
Cold water
Full moon
Deep grass
Cold water
