when i see you in your new blue jeans
i know you're lying, and i know what it means
when i see you take your place among the poor
i know you're a fraud for sure
bad priestess, bad priestess

so the sunlight plays its games along your eyes
and it has the same effect on a thousand other guys
and i'd be lying if i said i didn't feel the pull, too
but the sunlight makes me strong and i know about you
bad priestess

bad priestess, on a thursday as the sun goes down
bad priestess, with a super-special eyelash trick
bad priestess, bad priestess
