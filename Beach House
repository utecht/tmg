I get letters telling me since I moved away 
you've taken to hanging out on that rock about a mile from shore 
given what I know about that rock mainly that it's populated by seals 
I strongly suggest to you that you not hang out there anymore 
'cause the seal is a wily and a vicious creature 
and the seal will bite you if you give him half a chance 
yeah the seal has a mind set on violence 
and the seal is the sworn enemy of man 

now when I say that the seal is vicious I use the term advisedly 
according to webster's 9th new collegiate definition 4b. 

which states that vicious means marked by ferocity 
and offers as a synonym...savage 
'cause the seal is a vicious and a wily creature 
and the seal has a mind full of evil designs 
and the seal will harm you and laugh about it 
yeah the seal is not a creature you want to toy with 
yeah the seal is not a creature you want to toy with
