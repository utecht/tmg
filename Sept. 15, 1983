Long dinner with some friends
Way out way out in Portmore
Servants of he pharaoh 
Slip in through the open door
All business
Bearing knives and zip-guns
So get on the floor now every last one
Every last one

The heat drifts across the land
If I forget Israel 
Let me forget my right hand

And on the floor Michael James Williams
Feels his fingers start to freeze
And the whole sceneï¿½s like a movie
Paramedics on their knees

Try try your whole life
To be righteous and be good
Wind up on your own floor
Choking on blood

The heat drifts across the land
If I forget you Israel
Let me forget my right hand

And the house still smells like onions
When the ambulance arrives
Gabriel in postal blue
Loads up the car and drives to Spanish town
About three miles away 
Where will the wicked run to on that last day?

The heat drifts across the land
If I forget you Israel
Let me forget my right hand
