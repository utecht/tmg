when you came back from trenton,
all the sparkle was gone.
and you stood in the shadow
and the curtains were drawn

and i know you're lying.
and you know you're lying too.
that is just about the only thing i know about you.

when you pocketed your eyeshadow
and you picked up the phone,
stepped out on the balcony
and drank in the drone.

and i know you're leaving.
and you know you're leaving too.
that is just about the only thing i know about you.

when you stop on the sidewalk
and you looked up above you,
warm wet air came down to shelter me.
how much do i love you?

well you know you're dying.
and i know you're dying too.
that is just about the only thing i know about you.
