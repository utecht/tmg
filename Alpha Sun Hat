you say again that nothing's wrong
i'd really like to play along
your ruby red mouth is full and moist
i'd like to give in to your oboe reed voice
but as sure as those are buzzards in the guava tree
you're looking real funny at me

1 2 3 4,
that's not music you hear, that's the devil
that's not the sun up in the sky, it's a human heart
if you're planning your escape, you know i'm all for you
as i watch the sun come up again over tallahassee, florida
