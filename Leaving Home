we gathered up our worldly goods
stole off in the dark as quickly as we could
you were quieting the baby down
when we came to the dock on the outskirts of town

and looking back we saw china shrinking to the size of a coin
and then we saw water everywhere

when we climbed on board
they tied our things together with electrical cord
and then we set sail
as we held on tight to the cold iron rail
and I apologize but I don't know what I love more
you next to me there or the receding shore

we stood there in the cold
and the baby was six months old
we were passing him back and forth
when a cold familiar wind came down from the north

and looking back we saw china shrinking to the size of a coin
and then we saw water everywhere
