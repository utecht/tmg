You have got
that look in your eye
in the pinprick point where kindness goes to die
I'll be six years old next year
You erase me

you'll be sorry
you always feel sorry later on
when you come around to say so
I will be gone
and in my place meet my letter perfect body double
you erase me

when i got ready
to set out on my own
took up the reigns myself all through you
dug the spurs in clean down to the bone
but all that comes later
now there's only you and me
and the replica where my body used to be
you can go ahead and hit him
he feels no pain at all
you erase me
you erase me
