i know when you look at the photographs,
they don't do much for you.
i know you see the fires raging
baby, i see them too
and even though
you got your options all lined up in a row
there is something i want you to know.
i meant every word i said in new delhi.
every word.
every word.
every word.

i don't know where you're going,
and i don't want to know either.
i know you're heading north.
i know you've kept the keys in your pocket
breathe in, i see the moon shining down you
i know that you remember.
i can see it burning though.
in sanskrit, they got a word for it.
savasana.
savasana.
savasana.
savasana.
