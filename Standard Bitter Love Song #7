You smile at me in total defiance of all decency
Youâ€™ve got it down to science
That innocent look
Youâ€™ve got it practiced real good
But I know youâ€™d kill me if you could stand the sight of blood
If Id a been a fly on the wall a little earlier
If I had been one of the innumerable flies in this room
If Iâ€™d a been a fly on the wall a little earlier
It woulda been real different around here

You try to speak but the buzz is too loud
And itâ€™s hard to make you laugh through the dense black cloud
That surrounds us both
Itâ€™s just as well
You call the rope
Let the whole house go to hell

If Iâ€™d a been one of these flies
I would have lodged myself firmly underneath your eyelid
If Iâ€™d a been one of these flies a little earlier
It would have been real different around here.
