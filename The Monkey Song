cool air falls through the venetian blinds and
the planets in the heavens are perfectly aligned
i take in my surroundings
i memorize them all
the scuff marks on the stone floor,
the powder burns on the eastern wall

there's a monkey in the basement
how did the monkey get there?
there's a monkey in the basement
where did the monkey come from?
where did the monkey come from?
where did the monkey come from?

the animal noises you used to make
the andalusian coral snake
all hail when standing beside this room
and the heavy hot rains and the sonic boom

there's a monkey in the basement
where did the monkey come from?
there's a monkey in the basement
how did the monkey get there?
how did the monkey get there?
how did the monkey get there?
