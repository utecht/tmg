if you were anywhere near his door
you saw it swing open and you heard the moon roar
trying to yank herself right out of her orbit
the whole natural world, 
painted red, just like a target

it was a cold dark day
with low clouds standing in the way
and the stars jockeying for position
on the slow thick morning of the death-dealing physician
(oh yeah) x4

and you could feel his features in the air
a wide smile and perfect hair
he had complete control of the rising tides
and a medicine bag hanging at his side

it was a cold dark day
with low clouds standing in the way
and the stars jockeying for position
in the flowing blue world of the death-dealing physician
(oh yeah) x4

and the rain came down liike water from a faucet
i saw him at the crossroads, but i never saw him cross it,
one minute he was on this side,
and the next he was be over on the other.
so went his rounds, one sad patient after another.

it was a cold dark day
with low clouds standing in the way
and the stars jockeying for position
in the crushed velvet world of the death-dealing physician
(oh yeah) x4
it was a cold dark day
with low clouds standing in the way
and the stars jockeying for position
in the impossibly large office of the death-dealing physician
(oh yeah) x4
