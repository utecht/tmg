Well, I did it now
Oh, I did it now 
The box said do not open under pain of death 
It had my initials there where 
I signed my initials there on it 
On that white box 
I saw initials there 
Do not open under pain of death 
But I opened it anyway 
I died anyway 
I died anyway 
So I come back to stay (and say) 
Come back to stay 
Lord knows I love you anyway 
I love you anyway
