I don't mean to scare you, you’re leaving soon
But the wallpaper's melting, thoughts turning blue.
The light bulb is giving out shots in the dark
And the mad clarinet’s run away with your heart.

Remember that old tune,
The one that you cried to 
When you fell.
Yeah, it felt like you'd lost your mind.

You were not twenty-one when he first saw you.
How his melody cheered you, pitch rang so true.
Placed your lips to the mouthpiece, struck out a part,
Now the mad clarinet’s run away with your heart.

Do you remember that old tune?
The one that you cried to 
When you fell.
It felt like you'd lost your mind.

When you left that sucker on a moonlit night
You didn't bother looking left or you wouldn't look right
You nearly got run over by a ten ton truck
Got your pride you tried to make out like you...

When he received you,
Your hope simply fell through
So you cried.
Yeah it felt like you'd lost your mind.
