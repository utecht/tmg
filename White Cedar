Like a star come down to walk the Earth in radiant array.
I saw the light of my spirit descend the other day.
I was standing the bus stop on North East 33rd,
When I got the word.
I will be made a new creature, 
One bright day.

I don't have to be afraid.
Speed that day on it's way.
And you can't tell me what my spirit tells me isn't true, can you?

Woke up on lockdown one more time,
My visions won't ever learn.
But I see the light that much clearer,
Every time I return.
Forge my armor in the old fire.
My spirit sings loud and clear,
Even in here.

I'll be reborn someday, someday,
If I wait long enough.

I don't have to be afraid.
I don't wanna be afraid.
And you can't tell me what my spirit tells me isn't true, can you?
