The sun came out this morning, I was wide awake
Stumbled on down to the kitchen and I cut myself a piece of my birthday cake
Raspberry filling in the middle
I thought about you a little
And there was a time when you wanted me so bad it was eating you up inside
But this time has gone away

I poured myself a tall glass of milk, it was deep and cold
And I checked my drivers license, I was twenty-eight years old
And there was a time when you wanted me so bad it was eating you up inside
But this time has gone away
