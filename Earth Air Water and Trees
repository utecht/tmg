Through the shifting colours in the sky
I heard the wild geese call
The light was bright and clear and cold
Over eastern Montreal
And although
I know
You're only toying with me now
And although
You hold
Your affection for me like a 
Bone on a string
I love you
I love you because 
You gave me sausage and cheese
When I was hungry

You hold your closed hand out to me
And you told me to guess 
What you had inside
And I had a thousand guesses
And some of them were good
But I knew for sure that I was losing my mind
When the scent came rising 
Though the spaces between your fingers
When the scent called to me
And I knew we'd last 
At least 'til the end of December
And I love you
I love you because
You gave me sausage and cheese
When I was hungry
