badger time, it runs the same as mine
more or less once you deal with the mechanics
badger faces, all in our places
got no expressions, we offer no clues
won't you take a look, take a good look at my paws?
won't you take a look, take a good look at my paws?

we got the badger song, it isn't very long
sit down and listen this will only take a minute
badgers man, we do what we can
everybody's gonna have to do his part,
now won't you take a look, take a good look at my paws?
take a look, take a good look at my paws?
