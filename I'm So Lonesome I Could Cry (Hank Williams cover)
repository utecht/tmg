hear that lonesome whipporwill 
he sounds too blue to fly. 
the midnight train is riding low. 
I'm so lonesome I could cry. 

(sniff) 

I've never seen a night so long, 
when time goes crawling by. 
the moon just went behind the clouds 
to hide its face and die. 

(sniff) 

(sniff) 

did you ever see a robbin weep 
when leaves begin to die? 
that means he's lost the will to live. 
I'm so lonesome I could cry. 

the sign has come, a falling star. 
like love, a purple sky. 
they'll never wonder where you are. 
I'm so lonesome I could cry. 

(sniff) 

I'm so lonesome I could cry.
