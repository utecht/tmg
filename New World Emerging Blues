some day, some day mt. fuji's gonna blow.
some day, some day mt. fuji's gonna blow.
spray hot ashes on the villagers below.

some day, some day the ocean's gonna rise.
some day, some day the ocean's gonna rise.
and i will emerge from hiding and shrug off my disguise.

some day, some day the earth will be black as tar.
some day the earth will be black as tar.
and are gonna see each other the way we truly are.
